    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
    The one time we fished Glassmans it was pretty good. The water clarity was great
and the fish were active. Fishing with small spinners like junior Kamloopers, small
silver jakes, and small rooster tails worked very well. While the fishing was great
and all, the lack of space at the pond is really what killed it. By the time you
get more than five people fishing it gets really cramped. This is due to the fact
that most of the lake is covered with lily pads, so there is only a handful of
places to fish.
