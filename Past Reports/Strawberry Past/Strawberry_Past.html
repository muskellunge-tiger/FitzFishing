    Fishing is extremely good right now with tube jigs. The best tube jigs to use
are 2.5 to 3.5" white tipped with Chub meat. However, there are times where Chub
meat may not be needed, but to ensure good consistent action tipping your jigs will
be the best idea. The spinner and spoon bite has really died off now. This is
most likely due to the warmer water temperatures. The water temperature right now
is mainly in the mid-60s. <strong>(Report from: 7/17/20)</strong>

    Fishing is very good right now. The water temperature is mainly in the low 60's.
The best method is casting or jigging a 2" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat.
Spoons will also sometimes work as well. The best spoons to use are yellow and
gold or orange and gold Kamloopers. The best depths to target are 40 to 60 feet.
