    Water temperature is about 62 to 63 degrees in the morning and around 65 to
66 degrees in the afternoon. Most of the fish are still in a summer to fall transition,
but they are beginning to move up into shallower water and higher in the water
column now that the temperatures are dropping. Most of the fish are 20 to 35' down
and suspended in about 50 to 55' most of the time. 2.5 to 3" white tube jigs tipped
with Chub meat continue to work very well, but spoons are also beginning to work
as well. The best spoons for us were standard size Kamloopers that had gold as
some part of their coloring. The best Kamlooper was a standard size orange and
gold. We expect that in the next couple weeks the spoon fishing will increase a
lot when the fish get into full fall feeding.

    Water temperature has not really changed recently, and is still around 64 to 65
degrees. Fishing has continued to slow a little as we are now in the summer to
fall transition. Most of the fish right now are suspended in about 65 to 70' and
around 35 to 40 down. 2.5 to 3" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat continue
to be the best option. <strong>(Report From: 8/26/21)</strong>

    Due to the storms and cooler temperatures the past couple days, the water
temperature has dropped and now hangs around 64 to 65 degrees instead of 70. Fishing
is still a little slower, but it has improved a bit from the cooler temperatures.
2.5 to 3" white tube jigs on a 3/8oz. jig head tipped with Chub meat is still the
way to go. Casting and jigging both work well, but at times one will do better
than the other. Most of the fish are shallower, but suspended in deeper water. It
seemed that 60 to 65 feet was the best depth, and the fish would be hanging around
35 to 45 feet. <strong>(Report From: 8/20/21)</strong>
