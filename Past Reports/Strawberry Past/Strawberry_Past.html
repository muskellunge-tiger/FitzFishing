    Water temperature has not really changed recently, and is still around 64 to 65
degrees. Fishing has continued to slow a little as we are now in the summer to
fall transition. Most of the fish right now are suspended in about 65 to 70' and
around 35 to 40 down. 2.5 to 3" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat continue
to be the best option. <strong>(Report From: 8/26/21)</strong>

    Due to the storms and cooler temperatures the past couple days, the water
temperature has dropped and now hangs around 64 to 65 degrees instead of 70. Fishing
is still a little slower, but it has improved a bit from the cooler temperatures.
2.5 to 3" white tube jigs on a 3/8oz. jig head tipped with Chub meat is still the
way to go. Casting and jigging both work well, but at times one will do better
than the other. Most of the fish are shallower, but suspended in deeper water. It
seemed that 60 to 65 feet was the best depth, and the fish would be hanging around
35 to 45 feet. <strong>(Report From: 8/20/21)</strong>
