  <p>
    Fishing is good right now. There isn't much snow and slush on the lake, so
walking is pretty easy. For the fishing, we were in 60' of water, however, almost
every fish we caught was above 30'. Even though we would see a fair amount of fish
come through deeper, we were unable to get all but one to bite. The best jigs to
use are 2 to 3.5" white tube jigs, 1.5 to 2" green and white tube jigs, 2" green
Marabou's, and green or yellow Atomic tubes or teasers. We tipped our jigs with
either Chub meat or wax worms. <strong>(Report From: 1/6/21)</strong>
