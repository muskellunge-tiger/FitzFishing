    Ice thickness is over a foot now, and the fishing is good. We were in 55' of
water and most of the fish that came through were deeper in the water column and
on the bottom, with the occasional high flyer. The best lures for us were 2.75"
white tube jigs, 2" white beetle jigs tipped with Chub meat, and green Marabou's
tipped with pink corn. <strong>(Report From: 1/27/22)</strong>

    Ice thickness is around 12" now. The fishing has slowed a little, but
is still good. We were in around 50' using 2.75" white tube jigs tipped with Chub
meat and green Marabou's tipped with pink maggots. The fish were all throughout
the water column, so we used the white jigs for deeper fish most of the time and
the Marabou for shallower running fish. <strong>(Report From: 1/18/22)</strong>
