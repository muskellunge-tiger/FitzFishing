    Fishing is still very good. The water temperature is in the high 40s pretty
much the whole day, and the best depth to target 40 to 60 feet. Spoons like jumbo
Kamloopers and Apex Five of Diamonds worked well in the morning, but the best method
is to cast or jig 2 to 3.5" white tube jigs or twisty tails tipped with Chub meat.

    Fishing is still red hot. The water temperature is around 50 degrees all day
now. Spoons still work extremely well, but tube jigs are also beginning to work
very well too. The best spoon is a yellow or orange Apex Five of Diamonds with
red diamonds on it. Other spoons that work well are jumbo red and orange Kamloopers,
yellow and gold standard size Kamloopers, and large silver and green Pot-O-Golds.
When using tube jigs, 2 to 2.5" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz jig head tipped with
either nightcrawler or Chub meat works best. It is best to jig or drift troll the
tube jigs instead of casting them. If it is windy, it is best to cast the spoons
and drift troll the tube jigs at the same time to maximize your catching.

    Fishing for the most part is very fast. The only strange thing is that one day
you can catch over 100 fish and the next struggle to catch 30 to 40 with the same
weather conditions. Spoons are still the way to go. The best spoons now are large
Pot-O-Golds with the best colors being: gold, silver, silver and green, gold and
red/orange, and silver and orange. If smaller fish are following the larger
Pot-O-Golds, but not biting, then it is best to use the next size down but still use the
same color. Kamloopers also work well, the best colors for Kamloopers are: orange
and gold, red and silver, and yellow and gold. Like the Pot-O-Golds if you are only
getting follows on the jumbo Kamloopers then downsizing to a standard Kamlooper
will be the best option. Another spoon that will sometimes work is a yellow Apex
Five of Diamonds. If the spoons aren't working then Lucky Craft 115's or 2 to 3"
white twisty tail or tube jigs tipped with Chub meat will also work.
