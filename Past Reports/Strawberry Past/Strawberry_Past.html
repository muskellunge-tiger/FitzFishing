    The water temperature is 55 to 60 degrees depending on the time of day and
where you are on the lake. The summer to fall transition seems to be in full swing
right now, which means fishing is a little tough because a lot of the fish are spread
out in many different areas and depths. For us, the best depth seemed to be around
50'. The best methods continue to be tube jigs and spoons. The best tube jig continues
to be 2.5 to 3" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat. The best spoons are jumbo
orange and gold Kamloopers and yellow Apex Five of Diamonds, but large gold Pot-O-Golds,
and standard size Kamloopers will also work. In some cases, Lucky Craft 115's work
as well using a fast stop and go retrieve. <strong>(Report From: 9/21/21)</strong>

    Water temperature is about 62 to 63 degrees in the morning and around 65 to
66 degrees in the afternoon. Most of the fish are still in a summer to fall transition,
but they are beginning to move up into shallower water and higher in the water
column now that the temperatures are dropping. Most of the fish are 20 to 35' down
and suspended in about 50 to 55' most of the time. 2.5 to 3" white tube jigs tipped
with Chub meat continue to work very well, but spoons are also beginning to work
as well. The best spoons for us were standard size Kamloopers that had gold as
some part of their coloring. The best Kamlooper was a standard size orange and
gold. We expect that in the next couple weeks the spoon fishing will increase a
lot when the fish get into full fall feeding.

    Water temperature has not really changed recently, and is still around 64 to 65
degrees. Fishing has continued to slow a little as we are now in the summer to
fall transition. Most of the fish right now are suspended in about 65 to 70' and
around 35 to 40 down. 2.5 to 3" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat continue
to be the best option. <strong>(Report From: 8/26/21)</strong>
