    Ice thickness is around 12" now. The fishing has slowed a little, but
is still good. We were in around 50' using 2.75" white tube jigs tipped with Chub
meat and green Marabou's tipped with pink maggots. The fish were all throughout
the water column, so we used the white jigs for deeper fish most of the time and
the Marabou for shallower running fish. <strong>(Report From: 1/18/22)</strong>

    The lake is fully capped with ice now, and there is a lot of snow in some areas
and some access roadways can be difficult to travel. Fishing is great right now.
We were in 50' of water and caught most of our fish on 2.75" white tube jigs and
2" white beetle jigs. Most of the fish are around 30 to 45 feet down most of the
time. <strong>(Report From: 1/9/22)</strong>

    Most of the lake is frozen, but there are still some places in the middle of
the lake that are unsafe. Ice in safe areas is about 5" with a couple inches of
snow and slush on top. Fishing is pretty good as well. We were in 20 feet using
2.75" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat. The fish were pretty much through the
entire water column, and we tried other jigs along with the white ones, but they
only seemed to be interested in the larger white jigs.
