    The water temperature is in the low to high 60s depending on the time of day
and conditions. The fishing is red hot with tube jigs. The best tube jig to use is a
2.5 to 3" white jig tipped with Chub meat. Casting and jigging both work very well,
and the best depths to look for are 55 to 65 feet. The fish will likely be around
45 to 55 feet down depending on the water temperature and depth you are in.

    Water temperature is around 60 to 65 degrees depending on the time of day,
and the fishing is excellent. The best method for us was either casting or jigging
2-3" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat. Most of the fish seemed to be in about
45 to 50' of water while the water temperature was closer to 60 and then around
60 to 70' when the water got warmer. <strong>(Report From: 6/16/21)</strong>
