    Fishing is still very good. The water temperature is in the high 40s pretty
much the whole day, and the best depth to target 40 to 60 feet. Spoons like jumbo
Kamloopers and Apex Five of Diamonds worked well in the morning, but the best method
is to cast or jig 2 to 3.5" white tube jigs or twisty tails tipped with Chub meat.

    Fishing is still red hot. The water temperature is around 50 degrees all day
now. Spoons still work extremely well, but tube jigs are also beginning to work
very well too. The best spoon is a yellow or orange Apex Five of Diamonds with
red diamonds on it. Other spoons that work well are jumbo red and orange Kamloopers,
yellow and gold standard size Kamloopers, and large silver and green Pot-O-Golds.
When using tube jigs, 2 to 2.5" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz jig head tipped with
either nightcrawler or Chub meat works best. It is best to jig or drift troll the
tube jigs instead of casting them. If it is windy, it is best to cast the spoons
and drift troll the tube jigs at the same time to maximize your catching.
