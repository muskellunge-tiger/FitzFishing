    Fishing was very slow. We not only had a hard time catching fish, but we also
had a hard time just seeing fish in general. The jigs that kind of worked the best
were small white or green jigs. Other jigs that would also sometimes work were
green and white or blue pearl pepper tube jigs. We tipped all our jigs with either
a wax worm or Chub meat. <strong>(Report From: 3/2/21)</strong>

    The ice is around 15" thick with a couple inches of snow and slush on top, so
walking and driving vehicles on the lake can be difficult at times, especially
later in the day when the slush begins to melt. The fishing is pretty good right
now. Smaller jigs tipped with either wax worms or Chub meat seem to be the way to
go. The jigs we found the most success with were 1.5 to 2" yellow, white, and green
and white jigs. The fish seem to be spread across all depths of the water column
right now, but the ones that hit best seem to be in the mid-range. Which for us
was around 25 to 35 feet because we were fishing in a little over 60' of water.
