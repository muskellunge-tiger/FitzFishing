  <p>
    Ice thickness is at least 2' with a couple inches of snow on top. However,
fishing has slowed a lot. While we saw quite a few fish, we had a hard time getting
them to bite our jigs. But there were a few jigs that did pretty good. Those being
2.75" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat, and small green Marabou's tipped with
pink maggots or corn under a dodger. <strong>(Report From: 3/1/22)</strong>
