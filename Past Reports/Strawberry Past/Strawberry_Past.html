    Fishing is very good right now. The water temperature is mainly in the low 60's.
The best method is casting or jigging a 2" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat.
Spoons will also sometimes work as well. The best spoons to use are yellow and
gold or orange and gold Kamloopers. The best depths to target are 40 to 60 feet.

    Fishing is really improving. The best lure to use is still a 2" white tube jig
with a 3/8oz. head tipped with Chub or Sucker meat. Other lures that work are small
Lucky Crafts and spoons or spinners. Trolling pop gear and worm can be a great
way to catch a good amount of fish as well if the artificial bite is not working.
Generally, if it's calm or mostly calm then the artificialâ€™s will work best, and
while it is windy then trolling seems to work best.

    Fishing is fairly slow right now. The water tempurature is around 55 to 58
degrees depending on the time of day. Most of the fish are 25 to 40 feet down in
40 to 60 feet of water. The best lure to use is a 2" white tube jig with a 3/8oz.
head tipped with Chub or Sucker meat. The best way to catch the fish with the tube
jig is to cast or jig. Trolling pop gear or dodger with a a worm or small pink
squid. Spinners and spoons didn't work for us even though there was a fair amount
of fish breaking the surface. <strong>(Report from: 6/5/20)</strong>
