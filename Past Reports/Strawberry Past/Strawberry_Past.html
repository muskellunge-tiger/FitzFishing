    The ice is still plenty thick to walk on. However, on warmer afternoons, the top
does start to melt so it does get a little wet, but it's nothing too serious right
now. Fishing is still good, and smaller jigs are still the way to go. The jig that
dominated for us was a 2" white beetle jig with a black jig head tipped with
either wax worm or Chub meat. Yellow Atomic tubes and small white Trout magnet jigs
also worked well for fish that were higher in the water (15 feet or less). We also
found that if you are having trouble seeing fish, to either move or consistently
jig your jig to bring fish in. <strong>(Report From: 4/1/21)</strong>

    Fishing has improved a little bit. Smaller jigs are still the way to go most
of the time. The best jigs are small yellow Atomic tubs, 2" white beetle jigs with
a black jig head, and 2" green and white tube jigs. We tipped all our jigs with
either Chub meat or wax worms. It seemed that the fish were shallower in the
morning and deeper in the afternoon. We were in about 45 feet in the morning and
moved to about 55 feet in the afternoon. <strong>(Report From: 3/11/21)</strong>

    Fishing was very slow. We not only had a hard time catching fish, but we also
had a hard time just seeing fish in general. The jigs that kind of worked the best
were small white or green jigs. Other jigs that would also sometimes work were
green and white or blue pearl pepper tube jigs. We tipped all our jigs with either
a wax worm or Chub meat. <strong>(Report From: 3/2/21)</strong>
