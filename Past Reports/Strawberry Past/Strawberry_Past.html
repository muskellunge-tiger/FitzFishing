    Fishing for the most part is very fast. The only strange thing is that one day
you can catch over 100 fish and the next struggle to catch 30 to 40 with the same
weather conditions. Spoons are still the way to go. The best spoons now are large
Pot-O-Golds with the best colors being: gold, silver, silver and green, gold and
red/orange, and silver and orange. If smaller fish are following the larger
Pot-O-Golds, but not biting, then it is best to use the next size down but still use the
same color. Kamloopers also work well, the best colors for Kamloopers are: orange
and gold, red and silver, and yellow and gold. Like the Pot-O-Golds if you are only
getting follows on the jumbo Kamloopers then downsizing to a standard Kamlooper
will be the best option. Another spoon that will sometimes work is a yellow Apex
Five of Diamonds. If the spoons aren't working then Lucky Craft 115's or 2 to 3"
white twisty tail or tube jigs tipped with Chub meat will also work.

    Fishing has really picked up, and the water temperature is around the mid to
upper 50s all day. Spoons are the best way to go to catch the most fish quickly.
The best spoon is a jumbo gold and orange Kamlooper. Other spoons that work are
red and white spoons or large gold or silver Pot-O-Golds. The spoons seem to work
weather it is calm or windy. Another method to use while it's windy is to fish
2.5" white tube jigs around 20 to 25 feet down while you are fishing with spoons
to increase your catch number even more. If done right, it is possible to catch
100+ fish in a day. <strong>(Report from: 9/27/20)</strong>
