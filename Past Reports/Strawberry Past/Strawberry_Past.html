    Water temperature is around the high 50's pretty much all day now. The summer
to fall transition is still happening, but some more fish are starting to work
their way up shallower. Spoons and tube jigs continue to be the best way to go.
The best tube jig continues to be a 2.5 to 3" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat.
The best spoons are jumbo and large silver Pot-O-Golds, yellow Apex five of diamonds,
and jumbo orange and gold Kamloopers. Most of the fish are in 40 to 50' of water.

    The water temperature is 55 to 60 degrees depending on the time of day and
where you are on the lake. The summer to fall transition seems to be in full swing
right now, which means fishing is a little tough because a lot of the fish are spread
out in many different areas and depths. For us, the best depth seemed to be around
50'. The best methods continue to be tube jigs and spoons. The best tube jig continues
to be 2.5 to 3" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat. The best spoons are jumbo
orange and gold Kamloopers and yellow Apex Five of Diamonds, but large gold Pot-O-Golds,
and standard size Kamloopers will also work. In some cases, Lucky Craft 115's work
as well using a fast stop and go retrieve. <strong>(Report From: 9/21/21)</strong>
