    The fishing has really improved over the past couple weeks. The best jigs to use
are yellow Atomic tubes, white Marabouâ€™s, and small white beetle jigs. Bigger tube
jigs don't tend to work as well because the fish seem to not be after larger bait
right now. We recommend that you tip your jigs with either nightcrawlers, wax worms,
or Chub meat. While most of the fish are around 15 to 40 feet of water, you want
to fish in water that is a little bit deeper, like 60+ feet. Most of the fish are
around 15". <strong>(Report from: 3/29/20)</strong>

    There is pretty much no more slush on the lake and the ice is about 20" thick.
The fishing however, has slowed massively. While at lot of fish would come through
they would not bite very often at all. We believe this is because most of the
Cutthroats that would come through were very small, and who not be able to eat
bigger jigs, and then they would not be interested in smaller jigs either. The
best way to catch fish would be to drop a small yellow Atomic tube down about 15
feet down and wait for either Rainbows or Kokanee to come through. This is because
the Rainbows and Kokanee are bigger and much more aggressive then the Cutts right
now. However, this problem will likely change very soon.

    There is very little slush on the lake, and only a couple of inches of snow.
The fishing is pretty good right now, in about 50 to 60 feet of water. The best
lures to use are 2 to 3" white tube jigs and orange or white Marabou's. When using
the white tube jigs we recommend that you add a "stinger hook" to it because of
the fact that the fish sometimes nip at the tail of the jig. We also recommend
that you tip all your jigs with some sort of bait. The bait we used was a piece
of Chub meat. <strong>(Report from: 3/3/20)</strong>
