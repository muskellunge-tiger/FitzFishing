  <h1>Pineview Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The Crappie fishing is very fast right now. There are tons of large schools of
Crappie around the lake. The best jig for us was a 1" yellow atomic tube jig tipped
with either Perch meat or a pink maggot. When trying to find these schools, it
seemed that around 20 feet was the best depth. As for the Muskie fishing, it is
extremely slow. Due to the amount and size of the Crappie schools we believe that
a good portion of the Muskie have died because we did see multiple dead Muskie along
shorelines. <strong>(Report from: 8/27/20)</strong>

    Fishing is really good right now for panfish. The best jigs to use are small
yellow or red tube jigs tipped with either pink maggots or Perch meat. It is still
possible to catch fish without tipping your jigs, but if you add Perch meat then the
fish seem to bite more and faster. Most of the schools of fish are near the bottom
right now. If school is Crappie then it is best to drop the jig to the bottom,
then bring it up 2 to 3 feet and do a mixture of dead-sticking and jigging to get
bites. If the school is Perch then dropping the jig to the bottom and then reeling
till the line is tight and just waiting for the Perch to pick it up off the bottom
is the best option. As for the Muskie fishing, it is very slow right now. We think
this is mainly due to the lack of cover and structure in the water because the water
level is a little lower right now. <strong>(Report from: 8/12/20)</strong>
