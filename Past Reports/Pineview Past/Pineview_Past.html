  <h1>Pineview Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The ice is still plenty thick to walk on, around 10 to 12" not including the
couple inches of slush on top of the ice. However, the edges are starting to get
fairly soft, and to the point that you could break through in some areas later in
the day. Fishing has slowed at little, but it is still fairly good. The fish seem
to be around 40 feet of water now. The best lures to use are small green or fire
tiger ice flies tipped with either Perch meat, a Perch eye, or wax worms. We have
found that wax worms are the most consistent at getting bites. The fish are pretty
much always going to be on the bottom. <strong>(Report From: 2/9/21)</strong>
