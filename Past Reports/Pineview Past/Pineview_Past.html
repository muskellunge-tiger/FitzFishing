  <h1>Pineview Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The Crappie fishing is very fast right now. There are tons of large schools of
Crappie around the lake. The best jig for us was a 1" yellow atomic tube jig tipped
with either Perch meat or a pink maggot. When trying to find these schools, it
seemed that around 20 feet was the best depth. As for the Muskie fishing, it is
extremely slow. Due to the amount and size of the Crappie schools we believe that
a good portion of the Muskie have died because we did see multiple dead Muskie along
shorelines. <strong>(Report from: 8/27/20)</strong>
