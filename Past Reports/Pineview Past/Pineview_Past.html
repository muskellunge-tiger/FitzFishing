  <h1>Pineview Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is a little slow. Muskie fishing is not the best option right now.
However, the Crappie and Perch fishing is pretty good, especially the Crappie.
Most of the fish are in about 20 to 25 feet of water, and they are usually right
on or near the bottom. The best lure for us was a small white Marabouâ€™s tipped with
a pink maggot. Other lures that worked were small green and brown tube jigs also
tipped with pink maggots. <strong>(Report from: 5/8/20)</strong>
