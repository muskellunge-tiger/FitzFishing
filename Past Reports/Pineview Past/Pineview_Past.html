  <h1>Pineview Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The ice is around 6 to 7" thick. However, the narrows is still mostly open water,
so that area is not accessible right now. The fishing is fairly slow for panfish.
The best lure for use was a 1" green tube jig tipped with a piece of Perch meat.
The only other jig that worked for us was a 1" yellow Atomic tube. Pretty much all
the fish are on the bottom in around 30 feet of water.
