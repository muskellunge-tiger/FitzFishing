  <h1>Hobbs Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is extremely slow for Trout. We tried multiple different spinners,
spoons, and jigs and we only caught fish by bottom bouncing a small green and white
Marabou. <strong>(Report from: 10/5/20)</strong>

    The fishing has really slowed over the past few days. It seems most of the
Trout are now near the bottom, and are not hitting spinners and spoons near as
good as they were. It is still possible to catch them on silver or cooper Pot-O-Gold's,
but pretty much every other spinner or spoon didn't work.

    The water level is fairly high and the water is cool. The fishing is also fairly
good. Spoons and spinners are the best options right now, but the spoons are the
better of the two. The best spoons to use are silver or gold and red Pot-O-Golds,
fire tiger Daredevls, and sometimes junior Kamloopers will work too. The best
spinners to use are silver or green lil Jakes. When using the spinners or spoons,
it is best to let it sink a little before retrieving because some of the fish are
still not eating right on the surface yet. <strong>(Report from: 9/16/20)</strong>
