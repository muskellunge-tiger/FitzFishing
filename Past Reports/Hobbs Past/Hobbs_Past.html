  <h1>Hobbs Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The water clarity is still really good, and fish activity is still okay on the
surface, but the fishing is slowing down. Some spinners and spoons still work but
not as good as they were a few weeks ago. The best spoon is a red white and gold
junior Kamlooper and the best spinner is a green Li'l Jake.

    The water level is not as low as most other places and is quite clear. The
fishing is also quite good as well for both Bluegill and Trout. For Bluegill, try
finding some sort of structure or cover near the shore and then use a small jig
or fly around it to catch some of the small gills, we used a small pink jig. For
Trout, small spoons seem to work best. We used a red white and gold junior Kamlooper.
Most of the fish are not far out sometimes, so making shoreline casts is usually
a great way to catch the fish. <strong>(Report From: 10/14/21)</strong>
