  <h1>Lost Creek Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is beginning to slow down a little probably due to the fact that it
is getting late in the season. The best method right now is casting a 2.5" white
tube jig tipped with Chub meat. The other method that works is fishing on the
bottom with worm and a marshmallow on a 1 to 3' leader. Most of the fish are close
to the shore, so you do not have to cast out very far at all to catch the fish.

    Fishing is really good right now from shore. There a ton of Cutthroats and
other Trout species that are very close to shore. There is plenty of methods that
work to catch these fish as well ranging from bottom fishing, to tube jigs and spoons,
and bobbers. The two best of these methods is bottom fishing and jig fishing. For
bottom fishing, worm and marshmallow on 1 to 3' leader is the best. For jig fishing,
2.5" white and pearl tube jigs and large white beetle jigs tipped with Chub meat
work the best. There are also times where spoon fishing will work too, and the best
spoons for us were either yellow and gold or red white and gold Kamloopers. And
finally, bobber fishing which was the slowest for us, we used small white beetle
jigs and small yellow Atomic tubes about 1 to 2' below the bobber tipped with
pink maggots or salmon eggs. <strong>(Report From: 11/7/21)</strong>
