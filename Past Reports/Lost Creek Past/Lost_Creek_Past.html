  <h1>Lost Creek Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing does seem to be beginning to slow from shore. The Trout only seem to
be shallow in the early morning, and then head offshore by the afternoon, and only
a few Trout and mostly Chub seem to remain near shore. The only method that still
works is fishing on the bottom with half a worm and marshmallow on about a 1 to 4'
leader. <strong>(Report From: 5/18/21)</strong>

    Fishing has improved, but it's still a little slow. The jig bite has slowed
a lot, so bottom fishing is the way to go right now. When bottom fishing, it is
best to use half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 1 to 3' leader. The fish
seemed to be in deeper water in the morning, but then in shallower water later in
the day. So, keep that in mind when casting out your bottom baits.

    Fishing is still a bit slow, but there does seem to be improvements in fish
activity. There is more fish hitting the surface and more fish are hitting lures
and jigs. The two best methods are still fishing on the bottom and fishing with
jigs. When bottom fishing, half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 1 to 3
foot leader works best. When fishing with jigs, it's best to cast 2.5" white tube
jigs with a 3/8oz. jig head or a 2 to 3" white beetle jig with a black jig head
tipped with Chub meat. <strong>(Report From: 4/29/21)</strong>
