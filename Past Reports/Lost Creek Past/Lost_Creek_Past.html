  <h1>Lost Creek Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The water level is really low, but the fishing is really good for Chub even
from shore. You do not have to cast out far to catch a ton of Chub in a short amount
of time. While this may not seem like the best quality fishing because it is Chub
only it is still fun and if you use Chub for bait during other fishing trips, this
is a great opportunity to get a lot of meat stocked up. The best way to catch them
is to use either a 1 or 2 single hook rig with a small snap weight below both hooks
for a little weight to cast tipped with a small piece of worm. After casting out
let the rig sink to the bottom and if you're in the right area you should be
getting hits within seconds. <strong>(Report From: 8/15/21)</strong>
