  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The water level and clarity hasn't changed much recently. However, there is
now some large schools of fish hanging very close to the shore, sometimes within
visible range. While the fish aren't completely in fall feeding mode yet, they
are starting to get there. Spoons are a great way to pick fish out of the close
running schools. The best spoons for us were junior white red and gold Kamloopers
and standard size yellow and gold Kamloopers. <strong>(Report From: 10/4/21)</strong>

    Water clarity hasn't really changed much, and fishing is still slow with spinners
and spoons. There is a lot of fish surfacing very close to shore, but they don't
seem to be at the point where most of them are chasing spinners and spoons. The
spinners that worked for us were lil Jakes, and the best color was green.
