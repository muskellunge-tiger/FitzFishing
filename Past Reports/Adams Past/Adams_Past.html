  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The lake is now pretty much 100% full, but because there was a lot of water
put in the past few days the water is now very dirty. This pretty much makes it
impossible for spinners and spoons to work. We also saw a lot less fish activity
on the surface. <strong>(Report from: 4/3/20)</strong>

    Fishing is very slow right now with spoons and spinners. We tried multiple
different spoons and spinners. Along with multiple different colors, with only
a few that worked. The best spoons are a red white and gold junior Kamlooper and
white Pot-O-Golds. The best spinner is a green Jake, but all in all none of these
lures really perform better than the other. <strong>(Report from: 3/22/20)</strong>
