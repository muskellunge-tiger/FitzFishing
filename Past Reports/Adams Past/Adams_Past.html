  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is still slow most likely due to the still very dirty water. While a
lot of fish are breaking the surface because of the dirty water it makes it hard
for them to see spinners and spoons most of the time. The spinners and spoons
that occasionally work are silver and green #2 Bluefox's, fire tiger or black
and white Daredevls, and red and white junior Kamloopers.

    Due to the storm last weekend, the water clarity has really worsened. And
because of this, the water is now a little warmer as well. While there are a lot
of fish surfacing, because of the poor water clarity it is extremely hard to catch
them on spinners and spoons. The spoons that worked were fire tiger or black and
white Daredevls. We also tried tube jigs and saw people fly fishing and bottom
fishing with little to no luck as well. Fishing should get better again once the
water clears up and cools back down. <strong>(Report from: 9/23/20)</strong>

    Fishing is fair to slow. The water clarity is pretty good considering how warm
it has been. There are a lot of fish surfacing, so spinners and spoons are the
way to go. The best spoons are fire tiger Daredevls and yellow and gold Kamloopers.
The best spinner is a silver and green number 2 Bluefox. Some fish are very close
to shore, so making shoreline casts is usually the best way to go. While the fishing
may not be as good right now, we believe that it will get much better in the coming
weeks. <strong>(Report from: 9/15/20)</strong>
