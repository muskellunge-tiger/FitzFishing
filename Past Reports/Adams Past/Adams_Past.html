  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The water has come up from the recent storms and the water clarity has improved
as well. However, the fishing is still not great with spinners and spoons. There
is a lot of Bluegill near shore and some Trout are running close as well, but the
action wasn't red hot. The best spoons that worked for us was a red white and gold
junior Kamlooper, fire tiger daredevl, and either a silver and green or gold and
orange Pot-O-Gold. <strong>(Report From: 10/21/21)</strong>
