  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is still slow. The only color that we found to work was red. The best
lures to use were red Jakes, red, white, and gold Kamloopers, and small red
lipless crankbaits. The only other color that has a chance of working is green.
At this time, it is best to use bigger spinners and spoons in order to catch fish.

    The lake is now pretty much 100% full, but because there was a lot of water
put in the past few days the water is now very dirty. This pretty much makes it
impossible for spinners and spoons to work. We also saw a lot less fish activity
on the surface. <strong>(Report from: 4/3/20)</strong>
