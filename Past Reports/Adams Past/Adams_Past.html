  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Water clarity hasn't really changed much, and fishing is still slow with spinners
and spoons. There is a lot of fish surfacing very close to shore, but they don't
seem to be at the point where most of them are chasing spinners and spoons. The
spinners that worked for us were lil Jakes, and the best color was green.

    Fishing is very slow right now. However, the water clarity is not too bad and
there are quite a few fish busting on the surface, they're just a little far out
right now, and the water temperature is still a little warm. The best lures to use
are spoons, the best spoons are fire tiger Daredevls and either yellow and gold
or white red and gold standard size Kamloopers.
