  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The water clarity is stained and itâ€™s cold. The fishing is a little slow, but we
hope that when the water warms up a little it will pick up. Spinners and spoons
work fairly well right now. The best spinner was a silver and green #2 Bluefox and
the best spoon was a red, white, and gold junior Kamlooper. Of those two the Bluefox
was definitely better. Other spinners like #1 silver and green Bluefox's and lil
green Jakes also worked, but not as well. <strong>(Report From: 4/2/21)</strong>
