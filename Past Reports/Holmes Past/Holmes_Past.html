  <h1>Holmes Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is still pretty good with spoons. Most of the fish are still pretty
far offshore so using larger spoons remains the way to go. The best spoon right
now seems to be a fire tiger Daredevl, and a junior red, white, and gold Kamlooper
will also still work but not as well because it can't cast as far out as the Daredevl.

    Fishing is still good with spoons. However, because the water is starting to
warm up, the fish are starting to move farther offshore into deeper water. This
means that you have to use bigger spoons to get out farther to them. The best spoon
right now, is a fire tiger Daredevl. Sometimes a junior red, white, and gold Kamlooper
will work as well, but it doesn't get out as far as the Daredevl so it sometimes
struggles to get bites. <strong>(Report From: 4/20/21)</strong>

    The water temperature has increased and because of that the fishing is hot.
Spoons are the best way to go because most of the fish are still a ways offshore,
so having a little extra casting distance is key. The spoon that dominated everything
else that we used was a red, white, and gold junior Kamlooper. You may have to try
varying your retrieve speed to get them to bite. Sometimes they like it moving
faster and sometimes they like it moving slower. The fish are also heavily schooled
up right now, so if you catch a fish in one area, keep casting in that same area
until the school moves on. Then try casting in slightly different areas to try to
find that same school or a different school. Just always keep in mind that the
schools are constantly moving around. <strong>(Report From: 4/9/21)</strong>
