  <h1>Holmes Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The water level has dropped a little more, but the clarity remains pretty good.
Fishing has slowed a little because of the warmer temperatures recently, and
most of the fish are quite a ways off shore, but are still within casting range of
larger spoons. The best spoons right now are yellow and gold standard size Kamloopers
and fire tiger Daredevls. It is best to let your spoon sink to the bottom before
retrieving because the fish are also close to the bottom where it is cooler as
well. Most of the time the fish will hit right after you start retrieving the
spoon off the bottom. <strong>(Report From: 9/27/21)</strong>

    The water level is very low, but the clarity is pretty good. Fishing is also
good right now with spoons. Bigger spoons seem to be working better at the moment,
the best spoon for us was a fire tiger Daredevl, but standard size yellow and gold
Kamloopers also worked. Most of the fish are still quite a ways out, so having
a bigger spoon is also good for distance. When fishing with the spoons, it seems
to be best to let the spoon sink all the way to the bottom before retrieving, and
sometimes the fish will hit right after it comes off the bottom. Most of the fish
a very small 5-8". <strong>(Report From: 9/20/21)</strong>
