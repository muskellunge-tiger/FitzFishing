  <h1>East Canyon Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The water temperature is around 51 to 55 degrees depending on the time of day,
and the fishing is really good. There are multiple different methods that work.
The first, is casting spoons and spinners. This will really only work in the morning
and the best lures use are junior red white and gold Kamloopers and silver Jake's. The
next method is jigging or drift trolling small jigs. The best jigs to use are white
beetle bugs or trout magnets and small green tube jigs. If jigging always just
"dead-stick" the jig when a fish comes to it. The final method is trolling pop gear
and dodgers with a worm. The best pop gears are 4 bladed silver or gold willow leaf,
5 bladed Colorado multi-color. And silver dodgers will also work as well. Most of
the fish are in shallower water right now so using weight or down-riggers for
trolling is not really needed right now. <strong>(Report From: 5/13/21)</strong>
