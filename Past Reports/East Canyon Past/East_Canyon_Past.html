  <h1>East Canyon Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is extremely slow right now. The water temperature is 66 to 71 degrees
depending on the time of day. Most of the fish seem to be really spread out,
and if you do find a small group of fish, they tend to not bite anything. We tried
multiple different lures and methods from trolling to tube jigs to crankbaits
and spoons. We only caught fish while trolling silver willow leaf or tomahawk pop
gear and a worm and a small white and green Marabou.

    Fishing is pretty good right now. The only method that we found to work was
trolling either pop gear and a worm or a flatfish. The best pop gear to use was
silver and gold willow leaf or multi-colored Colorado blade pop gear. When fishing
with the flatfish, the only color we found to work was yellow. We also tried jigging
tube jigs and casting spoons, but with no success. <strong>(Report from: 5/28/20)</strong>
