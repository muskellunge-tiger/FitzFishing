  <h1>Farmington Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The water is very clear and fish activity is high on the surface. However, the
fishing seemed to be a bit slow with spinners and spoons. While spoons like Kamloopers,
Pot-O-Golds, and Daredevls and spinners like lil' Jakes worked, the fish didn't
seem to really be hitting them well even though there was a ton on the surface.
This might partly be due to the fact that there is a ton of grass still very close
to the surface from the hot summer and low water level, so most spinners and spoons
would get hung up in the grass very easily. Right now, it seemed that other anglers
were having success fishing on the bottom with bait.
