  <h2>Report and Stratagies</h2>
  <h3>Stratagies</h3>
  <p>
    When fishing Adams there are a few conditions to look for that will make your
fishing experence amazing. First, if your fishing with spinners or anything that is
going to be near the surface you want to be there on a day is not very windy. The
reason is because the trout tend to feed on the surface when it is calm. Second,
clear skies will help you in almost any circumstance, but it will help most when
fishing fast which seems to be the best stratagy at Adams. Now this does not mean
that if it is cloudy that you won't catch fish. It just means that you may not catch
as many fish. Third, if you are fishing fast, like with spinners or cranks, water
clearitiy is going to be the biggest factor when it comes to your success. If you
do run into a situation where the water is a little cloudy you can still fish fast
just simiply use a brighter bait like green or red, and maybe slow your reel down.
Finally, if you see fish jumping like crazy in a spot that nobody is already at
move to that spot as fast as possible. I have see a ton of times that if you go
to where the fish are jumping you will catch a ton of them, up to 30 or more, in
a short peroid of time long as you use the right gear.
  </p>
  <h3>Spring</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing Adams in the spring is a very easy task as long as you follow the few factors
dicussed above, and have the correct gear with you. When spring fishing at Adams we found that if
it was a sunnny day with clear water the best lure to use was a little silver jake.
On these days all you would have to do is cast it as far as you could, and just
reel back at a reasonably fast speed and just wait to get rocked! Alonge with the
silver jake, a red jake was also a great option especially if was cloudy or around
sunset as there was lower light making a bright jake a great option as well. Another
great lure to use where crankbaits. These things where great in the early evening
on very sunny days. They also tended to catch biggest fish at times, and some people
where also able to catch multiple Wipers with these. Some retreve stragies for crankbaits
where what I call hard twitch wait about a second reel hard twitch repeat. This method worked great for catching
Trout, and where most likely to hit after shortly after the first twitch. Another
method was just hard twitch after hard twitch, but it didn't seem to work as well as
the previous method. The final method was just cast and reel back at a decent speed. This
method seemed to work the best out of the three, and was the way some people where
catching Wipers. Unfortunally we where unable to catch a Wiper, but we did see others
catching them. All in all Adams in the spring was a great place to fish as we where
able to catch over a 100 fish in around ten trips with a high of 42 in just a few
hours. I strongly recomend this place for people who are learning how to fish as
you can catch a lot of Rainbow Trout in short amount of time, and the best thing
about the rainbows is that they will put up a great fight, but the don't fight so
hard that they are constintally breaking you off. Please know that if you are over
the age of 14 you are required the have an Access Permit, which is free, as well
as a valid fishing license.

  <h3>Fall</h3>
  <p>
    When it came to fishing Adams in the fall it just plan sucked, and the biggest
reason for this was do to the unusually hot summer that Utah had which caused Adams
water level to drop a ton. This caused the water clearitiy to really drop making
it impossible to fish with spinnes and have any sort of success. But in October
there where a few good days in which the same method from the spring worked. However,
unlike the spring crankbaits did not work, and silver jakes where a horrible option
do to the water. The best lures to use where little green and red jakes with a slitly
slower retreve. Behond that it was very hard to fishing Adams this fall.
