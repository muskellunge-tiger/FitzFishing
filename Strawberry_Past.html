  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    When we went to Strawberry ice fishing there was about 2-feet of snow on the
lake, so if you didn't have snowshoes walking would have really sucked. While the
fishing was very slow, we found that fishing in around 40-45 feet of water with
2" white tube jigs brought some success. Green colored jigs where also a good option.
We for the occasional fish that came through at around 15 feet below the ice, small
green 1-1.5" tube jigs worked well. While we did see a lot of fish come through
we had a hard time getting them to bite unlike previous trips. <strong>(Report from: 2/12/19)</strong>
