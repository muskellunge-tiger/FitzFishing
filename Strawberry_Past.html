  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    While there is a fair amount of slush on the lake, most of it has hardened,
but slush conditions constantly change so this may not be the case in a day or
two. As the fishing goes, it has slowed a little bit. The best depth for us was
around 35 to 45 feet. The best jig to use for deeper fish is a 2 to 3-inch white
tube jig tipped with Chub. We also recommend that you add a "stinger hook" to your
tube jig because the fish tend to just nip at the tails of the jigs, so this
will give you a better chance at hooking up. For higher flying fish, it is best
to use Marabou's. The specific color that we used was orange, but we have had success
with green and white as well. <strong>(Report from: 2/1/20)</strong>

    There is some bad slush in parts of the lake and a few inches of snow on the
ice, so it's a good idea to wear snowshoes and be very careful when driving snowmobiles
on the lake because of the possibly of getting stuck. As for the fishing, it's
pretty good. The best jigs to use are 2-3" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz. jig head
tipped with Chub meat. We recommend that you add a "stinger hook" to your jig because
pretty much all of the fish are just nipping at the tails of the jigs, so by adding
this you will have a much higher catch rate. When jigging it's a good idea to jig
lightly as this seems to cause the fish to bite better. However, if they don't
and are just looking, then it's a good idea to make a really quick half to one
turn of your reel to see if you can get the fish to follow. This will mostly likely
trigger a strike if they follow. If they don't hit it on the first crank but follow
aggressively, then just repeat the process and sooner or later they will likely
bite. Another good method was to fish a white Marabou with an orange jig head tipped
with half a worm about 10-15 feet below the ice to catch high flying fish. Most
of the fish are around 16". <strong>(Report from: 1/20/20)</strong>
