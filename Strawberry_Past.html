  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Water temperature is in the low 60s. Fishing has slowed a little when casting
white tube jigs, but has gotten much faster jigging them. We recommend using 2"
jigs tipped with Chub meat. Casting red and gold, and yellow and gold Kamloopers
got a lot of bites. You may have to let the Kamlooper sink a little, but most of
the time fish will be on the surface. When trolling for Kokanee, we found that using
silver willow leaf and tomahawk pop gear with wedding rings and squids tipped with
pink maggots would do pretty good. Just remember to try different depths till you
 find where the fish are. <strong>(Report from: 7/2/19)</strong>
