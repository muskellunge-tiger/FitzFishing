  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Water temperature is in the low 60s. Fishing has slowed a little when casting
white tube jigs, but has gotten much faster jigging them. We recommend using 2"
jigs tipped with Chub meat. Casting red and gold, and yellow and gold Kamloopers
got a lot of bites. You may have to let the Kamlooper sink a little, but most of
the time fish will be on the surface. When trolling for Kokanee, we found that using
silver willow leaf and tomahawk pop gear with wedding rings and squids tipped with
pink maggots would do pretty good. Just remember to try different depths till you
where the fish are. <strong>(Report from: 7/2/19)</strong>

    Water temperature is in the low 50s, and the water clarity is pretty good.
Casting and jigging white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat was the best method for
us in 40 to 60 feet of water. Most of the fish are suspended around 30 to 40 feet.
If you see fish surface in the morning try casting yellow and gold Kamloopers. When
the wind picks up in the afternoon trolling silver willow leaf pop gear or flashers
with worms or wedding rings tipped with pink maggots is a great option for catching
Cutts and Kokanee. <strong>(Report from: 6/24/19)</strong>
