  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Water temperature is around 65 to 66 degrees in the morning, and 68 to 70 degrees
in the afternoon. Most of the fish are 35 to 50 feet down in about 60 feet of water.
When it is calm casting and jigging white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat works
well. When the wind picks up jigging the tube jigs while drifting with the wind
is also a good method. If the jigs aren't working, then trolling silver or silver
and gold willow leaf pop gear with a worm will catch a few fish. You will have to
use weight, or down riggers in order to get your gear down to where the fish are.
