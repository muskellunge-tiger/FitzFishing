    Fishing is fair right now. What we found was that slightly deeper depths was
the way to go. The depth that we fished at was around 55 feet. While there was a
lot of fish coming through on the bottom, it was hard at times to get them to bite.
However, if fish came through higher in the water column then it would be a lot
easier to get them to bite. The be lures to use are 2 to 3" white or pearl tube
jigs tipped with Chub. We also added a "stinger hook" because the fish tend to
bite the tails. Marabou's also work well especially for fish that come through
at around 15 feet. <strong>(Report from: 2/16/20)</strong>

    While there is a fair amount of slush on the lake, most of it has hardened,
but slush conditions constantly change so this may not be the case in a day or
two. As the fishing goes, it has slowed a little bit. The best depth for us was
around 35 to 45 feet. The best jig to use for deeper fish is a 2 to 3-inch white
tube jig tipped with Chub. We also recommend that you add a "stinger hook" to your
tube jig because the fish tend to just nip at the tails of the jigs, so this
will give you a better chance at hooking up. For higher flying fish, it is best
to use Marabou's. The specific color that we used was orange, but we have had success
with green and white as well. <strong>(Report from: 2/1/20)</strong>
