  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The lake is fully frozen, and the ice is thick enough to walk on safely. Fishing
is pretty slow. Most larger jigs don't work, it is the smaller ones that do the
best. The best one for us was a 1" yellow tube jig tipped with one or two pink
maggots. A small white minnow shaped lure tipped with a wax worm worked good high
in the water column. Another jig that worked was a white and green tube jig tipped
with Chub meat. The fish are in pretty much the whole water column, but the fish
that come through high, 15 feet or shallower, will hit the best. Most of the deeper
fish, around 30 feet, will look for a long time but never really bite. Most of the
fish we caught were small, around 14", but there is some giant slot-buster sized
fish mixed in with the smaller ones. <strong>(Report from: 12/29/19)</strong>
