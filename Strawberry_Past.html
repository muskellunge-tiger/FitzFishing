  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The lake is ice free, and the water is fairly clear. Fishing from shore is slowing
down, but you are still able to catch nice Rainbows and Cutts. Try to steep drop
offs near shore, lake the dam on the Soldier Creek side. Fishing white tub jigs
with a 3/8oz. head tipped with chub meat will get a few bites. Large silver or
gold spoons like Kamloopers and Pot-o-Golds will catch good sized Rainbows and Cutts
at pretty good rate. If you see small chub swimming near the shore that are being
attacked by Cutthroats, use large Lucky Craft minnowbaits. Bait fishing for
us was not working at all. <strong>(Report from: 5/13/19)</strong>
