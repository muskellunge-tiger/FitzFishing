    The slush on the lake is very bad. Most of the fishing are around 20 feet below
the ice with some running a couple of feet below the ice and some near the bottom.
Smaller tube jigs are the best option. The best colors are white and green. Tipping
your jigs with worms or Chub meat will up your bite rate. <strong>THE ROAD TO THE
MARINA WILL CLOSE FOR THE SEASON ON MONDAY (MARCH 18) DUE TO HIGH SNOW LEVELS.

    Between the ice and snow there is around 2 feet before you get to the water.
Fish mainly come through at around 35-40 feet of water with the occasional high
flyer about 15-20 feet below the ice. Fishing dodgers with jig around 1.5-2 feet
below the dodger is a great way to catch and bring fish in. Smaller tube jigs also
work well with the best colors being green or white. Tipping your jigs with Chub
meat or worms will up your chances at getting a better bite. <strong>(Report from: 2/26/19)</strong>
