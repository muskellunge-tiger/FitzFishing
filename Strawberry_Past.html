  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is fast when it is sunny, but much slower when cloudy. Water temperature
is in the high 60s. Most of the fish are around 35 to 45 feet down. Casting and
jigging 2-3" white tube jigs with 3/8 oz. jig head tipped with Chub meat will catch
a ton of fish. Usually while it is calm casting works better, and while it is windy
jigging works better. You may also be able to catch a few fish on a spinner or spoon
on calm sunny mornings. <strong>(Report from: 7/31/19)</strong>
