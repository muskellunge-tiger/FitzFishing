  <h1>Strawberry Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Between the ice and snow there is around 2 feet before you get to the water.
Fish mainly come through at around 35-40 feet of water with the occasional high
flyer about 15-20 feet below the ice. Fishing dodgers with jig around 1.5-2 feet
below the dodger is a great way to catch and bring fish in. Smaller tube jigs also
work well with the best colors being green or white. Tipping your jigs with Chub
meat or worms will up your chances at getting a better bite. <strong>(Report from: 2/26/19)</strong>

    When we went to Strawberry ice fishing there was about 2-feet of snow on the
lake, so if you didn't have snowshoes walking would have really sucked. While the
fishing was very slow, we found that fishing in around 40-45 feet of water with
2" white tube jigs brought some success. Green colored jigs where also a good option.
We for the occasional fish that came through at around 15 feet below the ice, small
green 1-1.5" tube jigs worked well. While we did see a lot of fish come through
we had a hard time getting them to bite unlike previous trips. <strong>(Report from: 2/12/19)</strong>
