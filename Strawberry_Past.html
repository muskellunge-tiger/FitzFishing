  <p>
    Fishing is fair right now. What we found was that slightly deeper depths was
the way to go. The depth that we fished at was around 55 feet. While there was a
lot of fish coming through on the bottom, it was hard at times to get them to bite.
However, if fish came through higher in the water column then it would be a lot
easier to get them to bite. The be lures to use are 2 to 3" white or pearl tube
jigs tipped with Chub. We also added a "stinger hook" because the fish tend to
bite the tails. Marabou's also work well especially for fish that come through
at around 15 feet. <strong>(Report from: 2/16/20)</strong>
