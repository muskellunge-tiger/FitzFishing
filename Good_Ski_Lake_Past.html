  <h1>Good Ski Lake Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is starting to pick up even more now that the pond has been unfrozen
for a couple more days. There are 2 really good methods to use they are: bottom
fishing and fishing with 1.5-2” tube jigs or 1” Marabou's. When bottom fishing the best bait
to use is half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 6" leader. When fishing
tube jigs the best colors to use are yellow and orange, but other colors like green
and white will also likely work. When using Marabou’s, the best color is green and
white. We recommend that you tip you jigs with some kind of bait, we used pink
maggots, to increase bites. When fishing the jigs, it is best to either bottom
bounce or cast them out about 15 to 20 feet and just let it sit on the bottom. If
you are in an area that has a lot of fish then this method will sometimes get you
bites the second the jig hits the bottom. If that doesn't happen then within about
a minute you will get bit. If your jig is sitting for more than a couple of minutes
without a bite then recast it in a different area or try bottom bouncing to cover
more area till you find them. <strong>(Report from: 2/26/20)</strong>

    The pond is pretty much completely ice free, except on cold mornings when the
north side might freeze over a little. The pond is pretty full, and the fishing
is pretty good. The best method to use is fishing half a worm and half a marshmallow
on the bottom on about a 6" leader. Another method that works is bottom bouncing
yellow or orange tube jigs or small white and green Marabou's. We tipped our jigs
with pink maggots, but other bait like worms or even corn might work as well. We
just recommend that you tip your jig with some sort of bait.
