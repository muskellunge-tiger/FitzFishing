  <h1>Good Ski Lake Past Reports</h1>

    Fishing is great with tube jigs. You will want to use 1.5" orange, yellow, or
white tube jigs tipped with a pink maggot. You also want to use a lighter jig head
with a longer hook, so it sinks slower and so you have a better hookup chance. The
best method to catch them is using a bottom bouncing method. Most of the fish are
around 12", but there is plenty of 13-15 inchers as well.

    Fishing is pretty good. There is a lot of fish on the surface, so fishing spoons
and spinners works very well. The spoon we found to work the best was a fire tiger
Daredevil, and the best spinner was a green Jake. While spoons and spinners will
catch you a lot of fish, fishing a tube jig tipped with a pink maggot will get you
a ton of bites. The best tube jig to use is a 1.5" orange tube jig with a lighter
jig head inside. You will want to fish this using a bottom bouncing method, or a
slow retrieve method. Most of the fish are in the 12" range.
