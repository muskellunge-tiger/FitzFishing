  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    When ice fishing for Perch we found that small jigs worked well. On a good day
you can catch over 100 Perch, but we were unable to get anywhere near that. Mainly
because it was the first time we had ice fished for Perch which we found that it
was very hard to hook these fish because they are so small. We also tried to catch
Tiger Muskie through the ice and on the boat, but we were unable to hook up on one.
  </p>
  <h2>Tiger Muskie</h2>
  <h3>What is a Tiger Muskie</h3>
  <p>
    The Tiger Muskie or Tiger Muskellunge is a hybrid cross between a Northern Pike
and the True Muskellunge. Like all Muskies they are stealth predators that use underwater
structure like weeds, rocks, wood, etc. to attack their prey. Because Tiger Muskies
are hybrids they are unable to reproduce. This is a good thing because we don't have to
worry about the population getting out of control. Therefore, in Utah it is illegal to keep
a Tiger Muskie. All Tiger Muskie that are caught are to be immediately released.
Tiger Muskie can grow to lengths over 50" in Utah making them an amazing sport fish
to catch. Tiger Muskie, and all Muskie in this regard, are considered to be a fish
of a thousand casts as they are very hard to catch. Tiger Muskie in Utah are put
into lakes to kill off populations of pan and trash fish. This along with the fact
that they can't reproduce is the main reason they are illegal to keep in the three major
bodies of water they are found in, in Utah.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are few places in Utah that are known for having good Tiger Muskie fishing
these places include: Newton, Scofield, Pineview, and a few others, but Newton and
Pineview have had Muskie the longest with Scofield getting stocked with them in 2017.
The number one place in Utah for Muskie fishing is Pineview. This is the place were
the biggest Muskie in the state was caught coming in at a massive 53.25", and Muskie
pushing 50" are caught, but are a rare occurrence in Pineview.
  </p>
  <h3>Gear and Strategy Options</h3>
  <p>
    Do to the fact that Tiger Muskies are hybrids they will tend to fight very hard,
and Muskies do this any way. So, you need to bring heavy tackle with heavy line, and
a pretty heavy action rod to be able to land one of these beasts. The best line to
use is braided line as it is the most powerful fishing line. People will use a pretty
large variety of line weights for these fish ranging from 30 to 85-pound braid, but
you don't really need to be on the upper end of the limit to have a very good chance.
If you use 30 to 50-pound braid you will be okay most of the time when it comes to catching
a Muskie. Along with the braided line you are going to want to have wired leader.
The reason for this is because Tiger Muskie have big teeth for a freshwater fish
so without wire leader they can easily break your line with their teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to lures there is a massive variety of sizes, and types of lures
that work for Muskie. But in Utah, the best size range is 4 to 6 inches, but you
can go higher or lower if you want. For example, our biggest Tiger Muskie was caught
at Pineview on a 2" Crappie swimbait, but almost all of our others ones have been
on 4" bass colored swimbaits. So, when you are fishing for Tiger Muskie consider
these things:
  </p>
  <br>
  <p style="text-indent: 100px;">
<strong>1.</strong> Know what the bait fish are in the body of water that you are
fishing in. For example, in Pineview the main prey of the Tiger Muskie is Crappie,
Perch, and sometimes small Bass. Therefore, you <p style="text-indent: 120px;">are
going to want to go to lures that look like those fish. Now this does not mean that
you have to use lures that look like those fish. It's just that your odds may be
better if you do.</p>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p style="text-indent: 100px;">
<strong>2.</strong> Know the weather conditions. It is very well known that Muskie
are more likely to hit if a storm front is coming in or moving out. I find this
to be true as the on time we fished for Muskie before a <p style="text-indent: 120px;">
storm came in, we caught a Muskie within 50 minuets where as it usually takes us
several hours to catch one. But just like with the lures, you do not have to fish
for Muskie right before or right </p><p style="text-indent: 120px;">after a storm
to catch one.</p>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p style="text-indent: 100px;">
<strong>3.</strong> Always be moving along shorelines of the lake. Tiger Muskie are very territorial,
and will usually have an area the they patrol when they are hungry. So, it is important
that you keep moving in <p style="text-indent: 120px;">order to maximize your
chances. If you do catch a Tiger Muskie DO NOT stay in that spot. Unlike other species
of fish Tiger Muskie are at the top of the food chain, and have to eat a lot of
fish </p><p style="text-indent: 120px;">to survive. Therefore, they don't travel in schools
they are lone predators, so it is extremely unlikely that you will find 2 Muskie
in the same spot. While it is possible it is pretty rare, and I have </p><p style="text-indent: 120px;">only seen it
one time when there were 2 Muskie in the same spot.</p>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p style="text-indent: 100px;">
<strong>4.</strong> When you bring your lure back to the boat do not immediately
pull it out of the water. Tiger Muskie will commonly follow your lure all the way
to the boat, and use the boat for cover to launch <p style="text-indent: 120px;">
a surprise attack. They may also use dirty water and their camouflage abilities
to their advantage. This means that you must be ready at all times because you
never know when a Muskie will </p><p style="text-indent: 120px;">launch a surprise
attack. If a Muskie swipes at your lure but misses keep your lure in the water,
and perform figure 8's with your lure. This may cause the Muskie to come back and
strike again.</p>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Following these basic steps could up your chances of catching a Tiger Muskie.
Please keep in mind that Tiger Muskie are not for beginner fisherman they are very
strong, and can reach weights over 30 pounds, and they require a massive amount of
time and effort to catch, so if you don't have very high patients these are not
the fish for you. Now it is possible if you are a beginner to catch a Tiger Muskie
if you are with someone who knows what they are doing, and that you understand that
you can cast for a whole day and catch nothing.
  </p>
  <h3>When Fighting and Landing Tiger Muskie</h3>
  <p>
    When a Tiger Muskie attacks, you will probably not see it coming, and they will
usually hit your lure with incredible force, so you must be ready for this to happen
at any time even if you have been fishing for 6 hours with nothing. Once the fight
begins you won't really be able to do anything but hold on. The reason is because
the Muskie will likely run at a very high speed all the way to the bottom, and that
is when the fight begins. You will likely not see the Muskie for a while unless
you are using very heavy tackle otherwise after a little while the Muskie will come to
the surface, but this does not mean the fight is over. They will likely take another
run to the bottom, and fight even more. This could happen a number of times especially
if the Muskie is in that 50" range.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the Muskie is ready to be landed it will come to the surface, and not take
off again. At this time you will want to have another person who knows what they are doing
to net the Muskie. You are going to want a pretty large net for these things do to
their size. For the person netting they need to be ready for the Muskie to: thrash
around, try to run to the bottom, or do both.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the Muskie is netted, and has thrashed around a bit they are actually pretty
clam this is probably do to the fact that they are worn out from the fight. Once
they clam down keep the Muskie in the water to unhook them. The reason for this
is because the Muskie is at this point very tried and needs to rest, and even though
there big they do not last out of water for very long. This means that you need
have them out of the water for a minute or less, so they don't die. Now it is possible
to unhook them, take pictures, and kind of admire them if you are very quick, and
have all your stuff ready before they come in the boat. But this is not recommended
to do. When unhooking the Muskie, you are going to need a large set of plyers because
Tiger Muskie have very large teeth that will send you to the hospital to get stiches
if you are not careful, and get bit. <strong style="color: black;">THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT TIGER MUSKIE
WILL JUST RANDOMLY ATTACK YOU IF YOUR SWIMMING. THEY ONLY BITE PEOPLE WHO CATCH
THEM, AND ARE NOT CAREFUL WHEN TRYING TO UNHOOK AND HANDLE THEM!</strong>
  </p>
  <h3>Handling</h3>
  <p>
    When it comes time to handle the Muskie always hold it horizontally. Absolutely
NEVER hold the Muskie vertically that is not a nature position for them to be in
whereas horizontally is. When holding the Muskie, you can either hold with one hand
in its gills (just watch for the gill rakers as they are sharp) and support the
tail with you other hand. The other way is to hold the tail with one hand and use
your other to support its belly. While each method is great, I prefer method 2 over
one as you have more maneuverability if they start to thrash. Lucky Muskie don't
tend to thrash around when you are holding them, but it could happen so just always
be ready.
  </p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    While Tiger Muskie look really cool do their size and looks, they are not a very
hardy fish out of water, like Catfish and Carp, like some people might think they are. This means that you
can't keep them out of the water for a very long time admiring them because they
will die quick. This is why it is important to have everything you need ready when
a Muskie is caught, this includes plyers and cameras. I recommend that you record
the fight, and take a lot of pictures because you can do that in seconds these days.
Once you do that get them released, and when get home you can admire the video and
pictures for as long as you want. The reason for this is because you have to remember
that these fish are put into these lakes to control that populations of small fish
so the fishing in the lake remains good, so if you are always keeping these fish
out of the water for a very long time and pretty much killing them, you are ruining
fishing for others in the future, and remember they can't reproduce.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that you have some knowledge on how to catch Tiger Muskies better, if your
a beginner and really want to catch one get out there with people who know what
is going on and catch yourself an amazing sport fish. If you are already an experienced
fisherman who hasn't caught a Tiger Muskie yet I hope some of these tips will help
you succeed in the future, and remember no matter what your fishing skill is always
be careful cause you don't want the Muskie you caught to put a hospital visit in your
day.
