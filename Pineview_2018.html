  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    When ice fishing for Perch we found that small jigs worked well. On a good day
you can catch over 100 Perch, but we were unable to get anywhere near that. Mainly
because it was the first time we had ice fished for Perch which we found that it
we very hard to hook these fish because they are so small. We also tried to catch
Tiger Muskie through the ice and on the boat, but we were unable to hook up on one.
  </p>
  <h2>Tiger Muskie</h2>
  <h3>What is a Tiger Muskie</h3>
  <p>
    The Tiger Muskie or Tiger Muskellunge is a hybrid cross between a Northern Pike
and the true Muskellunge. Like all muskies they are stealth predators that use underwater
structure like weeds, rocks, wood, etc. to attack there prey. Because Tiger Muskies
are hybrids they are unable to reporduce therefore, in Utah it is illegal to keep
a Tiger Muskie. All Tiger Muskie that are caught are to be imeditally released.
Tiger Muskie can grow to lenghts over 50" in Utah making them an amazing sport fish
to catch. Tiger Muskie, and all muskie in this reguard, are concidered to be a fish
of a thousand casts as they are very hard to catch. Tiger Muskie in Utah are put
into lakes to kill off populations of pan and trash fish. This along with the fact
that they can't reproduce is the main reason they are illegal to keep in the three major
bodies of water they are found in, in Utah.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are few places in Utah that are known for having good Tiger Muskie fishing
these places include: Newton, Scofield, Pineview, and a few others, but Newton and
Pineview have had Muskie the longest with Scofield getting stocked with them in 2017.
The number one place in Utah for Muskie fishing is Pineview. This is the place were
the biggest Muskie in the state was caught coming in at a massive 53.25", and Muskie
pushing 50" are caught pretty are not a super rare occurence in Pineview.
  </p>
  <h3>Gear and Strategy Options</h3>
  <p>
    Do to the fact that Tiger Muskies are hybrids they will tend to fight very hard,
and Muskies do this any way. So you need to bring heavy tackle with heavy line, and
a pretty heavy action rod to be able to land one of these beasts. The best line to
use is braided line as it is the most powerful fishing line. People will use a pretty
large variety of line weights for these fish ranging from 30 to 85 pound braid, but
you don't really need to be on the upper end of the limit to have a very good chance.
If you use 30 to 50 pound braid with will be more then okay when it comes to catching
a Muskie. Along with the braided line you are going to want to have wired leader.
The reason for this is because Tiger Muskie have big teeth for a freshwater fish,
so without wire leader they can easily break your line with there teeth.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to lures there is a massive variety of sizes, and types of lures
that work for Muskie. But in Utah, the best size range is 4 to 6 inches, but you
can go higher or lower if you want. For example, our biggest Tiger Muskie was caught
at Pineview on a 2" Crappie swimbait, but almost all of our others ones have been
on 4" bass colored swimbaits. So when you are fishing for Tiger Muskie consider
these things:
  </p>
  <br>
  <p style="text-indent: 0px;">
<strong>1.</strong> Know what the bait fish are in the body of water that you are fishing in. For
example, in Pineview the main prey of the Muskie are Crappie, Perch, and sometimes
small bass. Therefore, you are going to want to go to lures that look like those
fish. Now this does not mean that you have to use lures that look like those fish.
It's just that your odds may be better if you do.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0px;">
<strong>2.</strong> Know the weather conditions. It is very well known that Muskie are more likely
to hit if a storm front is coming in or moving out. I find this to be true as the
on time we fished for Muskie before a storm came in we caught a Muskie within 50
minuets where as it usually takes us several hours to catch one. But just like with
the lures, you do not have to fish for Muskie right before or right after a storm
to catch one.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0px;">
<strong>3.</strong> Always be moving along shorlines of the lake. Tiger Muskie are very territorial,
and will usually have an area the they patrol when they are hungry. So it is important
that you keep moving in order to maximize your chances. If you do catch a Tiger Muskie
DO NOT stay in that spot. Unlike other species of fish Tiger Muskie are at the top
of the food chain, and have to eat a lot of fish to survive. Therefore, they don't
travel in schools they are lone predators, so it is extremely unlikely that you will
find 2 Muskie in the same spot. While it is possible it is pretty rare, and I have
on it one time when there were 2 Muskie in the same spot.
  </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0px;">
<strong>4.</strong> When you bring your lure back to the boat do not imeaditally
pull it out of the water. Tiger Muskie will commonly follow your lure all the way
to the boat, and use the boat for cover to launch a surpise attack. The my also
use dirty water and there camoflage abilites to there advantage. This mean that
you must be ready at all times because you never know when a Muskie will launch a
surpise attack.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Following these basic step will up your chances of catching a Tiger Muskie.
Please keep in mind that Tiger Muskie are not for beginner fisherman they are very
strong, and can reach weights over 30 pounds, and they require a massive amount of
time and effort to catch, so if you don't have very high patients these are not
the fish for you. Now it is possible if you are a beginner to catch a Tiger Muskie
if you are with someone who knows what they are doing, and that you understand that
you can cast for a whole day and catch nothing.
