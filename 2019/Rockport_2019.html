    <h1>Rockport Report 2019</h1>
    <h2>Statistics</h2>

    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      While we didn't go to Rockport much this year, the times we did the fishing
was pretty good. The method that worked best was casting or trolling spoons. The
other method that worked well was trolling pop gear or triangle flashers with a
worm. While most of the fish where small, around 13 to 15", there were still some
bigger fish around. There was also a large amount of algae in the water in the fall.
However, this algae was not toxic, and didn't seem to hinder the fish activity in
any way.
