    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      While we didn't go to Rockport much this year, the times we did the fishing
was pretty good. The method that worked best was casting or trolling spoons. The
other method that worked well was trolling pop gear or triangle flashers with a
worm. While most of the fish where small, around 13 to 15", there were still some
bigger fish around. There was also a large amount of algae in the water in the fall.
However, this algae was not toxic, and didn't seem to hinder the fish activity in
any way.

      Because the fish were very active on the surface two of the times we were
at Rockport, the spoon fishing was the best option by far. The spoon that seemed
to be the best of them all was a Perch patterned Thunderbolt. This made sense
since the main forage of fish for the Trout would be Perch. Other spoons that worked
included a silver and green Pot-O-Gold, yellow and gold Kamlooper, fire tiger
Daredevil, and small gold Castmasters. When casting these spoons, you would sometimes
have to let them sink a little bit if the fish weren't right on the surface. The
only time this really came into play was shortly after sunrise. After the sun had
been up for a little bit the fish would come up to the surface to feed which meant
you didn't need to let the spoons sink. If you were ever having trouble catching
fish casting, then trolling those same spoons would be the way to go. You would
just have to troll at a couple miles per hour, and that would do pretty good.
Trolling spoons is also a good way to find where large groups of fish are in a
short amount of time while still fishing and likely catching. This was by far
the best method to use at Rockport this year.
