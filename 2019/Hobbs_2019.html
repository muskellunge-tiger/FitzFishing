    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      In late spring Hobbs was stocked with 13-inch Cutthroat Trout. This caused
the fishing to be excellent for a few weeks. Fishing with spinners and spoons in
the mornings and evenings was a great way to catch some decent sized Cutthroats.
The best spinner to use was a silver Jake while the best spoons to use were a silver
Crocodile or a silver and blue Kastmaster. However, orange and gold Kamloopers
would also work, but not as well because they dove to deep. When it came to retrieving
the spoons and spinners, a slower retrieve worked well for the Jake because that
is how you got the maximum action out of it. A fast retrieve was good for the
Crocodile and the Kastmaster.

      Unfortunately, because this happened in late April into early May the bite
did not last that long, as summer was coming in quick, and the water temperature
began to rise quick and the fish moved out of range for shore fishing. We didn't
fish Hobbs much in the fall due to the success that Adams had brought.
