    <p>
      It was a pretty good year fishing at East Canyon. However, most of the fish
where very small, only around 12 to 13 inches for most of the year, but there where
still some decent sized fish here and there. Most fishing methods worked most of
the year. When fishing from shore fishing on the bottom with half a worm and half
a marshmallow with about a foot and a half leader with a standard water-bubble as
the weight worked the best. If you don't know what a water-bubble is please read
the paragraph at the bottom of the page. Another good method to use from shore was
fishing a bobber with half a worm around 3 feet below the bobber. For the most part
we found that fishing with spoons, spinners, and tube jigs didn't produce much bites
at all.
