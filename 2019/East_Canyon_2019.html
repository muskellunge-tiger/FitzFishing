    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      It was a pretty good year fishing at East Canyon. However, most of the fish
where very small, only around 12 to 13 inches for most of the year, but there where
still some decent sized fish here and there. Most fishing methods worked most of
the year. When fishing from shore fishing on the bottom with half a worm and half
a marshmallow with about a foot and a half leader with a standard water-bubble as
the weight worked the best. If you don't know what a water-bubble is please read
the paragraph at the bottom of the page. Another good method to use from shore was
fishing a bobber with half a worm around 3 feet below the bobber. For the most part
we found that fishing with spoons, spinners, and tube jigs didn't produce much bites
at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When fishing from a boat the best method to use was trolling pop gear, dodgers,
and triangle flashers with half a worm. The best pop gear was 4 bladed silver or
gold willow leaf. The best flashers where gold, silver, and green. We didn't fish
dodgers much, but the best color to use was silver. In the early summer weight was
not massively important as the fish were still high in the water column, but later
in the summer weight or down riggers where more important as the fish where now
deeper in the water. Just like with shore fishing we found the spinners and spoons
where not that effective, but the ones that worked the best where red Daredevils
and white Jakes. However, in the fall the tube jig fishing was excellent it just
required a little searching for the best results. The best tube jig to use was a
white and green jig tipped with a pink maggot. The most effective way to use this
would be to get over a large school of fish. To do this we recommend using
electronics to not only find the fish but also the depth they are at. Once you
found a school of fish, dropping the jig down to them and jigging it would catch
a very large amount of fish in a very short amount of time. While the jigging method
was great it didn't always work and that's when we would resort to trolling. The
biggest thing to remember at East Canyon is the fish move quite often, so you just
have to move with them in order to catch a lot of them.

    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
