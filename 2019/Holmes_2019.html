    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      After a slow start in early spring Holmes fishing got really good. The main
reason for this was because of a few stockings of around 1,700 fish, and very good
water clarity. The best method to use was either fishing a small spoon or fly
fishing. The only spoon we found to work very well was a red, white, and gold
junior Kamlooper. However, small Pot-O-Golds and small silver lipless crankbaits
would sometimes catch fish. When fishing with these lures a slower retrieve was
the way to go. For example, you would only want the small spoons to swing side to
side instead of spin. We also found that the fishing was best when the weather was
horrible. If it was raining or snowing that was when the fish seemed to be the most
active on the surface. If you were fly fishing you would need to cast your fly out
a long way, probably around 40-50 feet, or fish in a non-motorized boat in order
to reach the fish. Bottom fishing also worked quite well, just not as well as the
spoons or the flies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it came to the fall the water clarity had gotten bad, and the bite had
really slowed. The fish were not hitting spoons or flies very well at all. Most
of the fish that were in close were small Bluegill and Bass while the Trout were
out in the deeper water. We never really fished Holmes in the fall due to the success
that Adams had brought.
