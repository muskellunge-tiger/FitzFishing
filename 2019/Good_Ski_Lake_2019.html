    <h1>Good Ski Lake Report 2019</h1>
    <h2>Statistics</h2>

    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Good Ski Lake was a lake that we started fishing in the fall, and it turned
out to be a great place to fish. In the beginning of October, the spinner fishing
was pretty good. The spoons and spinners we found to work were lil and standard green Jakes along
with a fire tiger patterned Daredevil. Kamloopers like a red, white, and gold junior
Kamlooper and yellow and gold standard sized Kamlooper worked well, but not as
good as the Jakes and the Daredevil. While most of your catches would be Trout,
there was the possibility of catching small Largemouth Bass using the Jakes. The best way
to effectively use these spinners was to find an area where there were a lot of fish
jumping. When retrieving the Jakes, a slower retrieve was better, this would be the
same with the Kamloopers. However, when using the Daredevils, a faster retrieve
worked better. We didn't fish Good Ski much in October due to the success that Adams
brought.
