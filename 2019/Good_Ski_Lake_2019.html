    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Good Ski Lake was a lake that we started fishing in the fall, and it turned
out to be a great place to fish. In the beginning of October, the spinner fishing
was pretty good. The spoons and spinners we found to work were lil and standard green Jakes along
with a fire tiger patterned Daredevil. Kamloopers like a red, white, and gold junior
Kamlooper and yellow and gold standard sized Kamlooper worked well, but not as
good as the Jakes and the Daredevil. While most of your catches would be Trout,
there was the possibility of catching small Largemouth Bass using the Jakes. The best way
to effectively use these spinners was to find an area where there were a lot of fish
jumping. When retrieving the Jakes, a slower retrieve was better, this would be the
same with the Kamloopers. However, when using the Daredevils, a faster retrieve
worked better. We didn't fish Good Ski much in October due to the success that Adams
brought.

    <p>
      While the October fishing was good, the November fishing was excellent. At
the beginning of November there was still quite a few fish hitting the surface, so
the same spoons and spinners previously mentioned were still working. However, by
the middle of November the spoon and spinner bit had stopped, and the tube jig bite
was on. The best tube jigs to use were 1.5" yellow, orange, or white with yellow
and orange being the best to use. You would also have to tip your jig with some
sort of bait. The bait we used was a pink maggot. You could fish your jig just
plan and still get bites, but not near as good as when it was tipped. You would
also want a lighter jig head in your jig. The reason will be explained when we
talk about the best method to use.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best method to use was a bottom bouncing
method. Because the bottom is pretty clean, and the fact that the jigs are light
you wouldn't get snagged often or really at all. The reason you would want a lighter
jig head was because it would take longer for the jig to sink back to the bottom
between jigs. This would give the fish a better chance to see the jig in the water
column, and may also attract a few suspended fish. When it came to the bottom
bouncing, you would want to work slow. After casting out as far as you can, and
the jig hits the bottom. Wait around 10 seconds, the reason for this is because
any fish that saw the jig falling might be checking it out, and quite often while
youâ€™re waiting the fish will just pick it up. If this doesn't happen, reel up the
slack and do a slow vertical jig reel down and wait for the jig to hit the bottom
again. Once it has hit the bottom again wait a few second to see if a fish takes.
If this doesn't happen repeat the process. Most of the time you will get hits on
your first two jig or last two jigs. Also remember that this is a finesse tactic
so, if you are not used to this type of fishing you will miss a lot of fish, this
also goes for people who are experienced with finesse fishing. What you have to remember
is that this is how finesse fishing works, and the fact that you are going to most likely
be getting hit on every cast, so the chances of getting a fish are high. The biggest
thing to remember when doing this is when you see a bite, don't set the hook right
away you will miss pretty much every time. Instead wait a few seconds for the fish
to take most of the slack out of the line, and fully eat the jig before setting the
hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we found out and got really good at this method it was pretty much
guaranteed that we were going to catch at least 30 fish, but most the time we
where over that, and sometimes we were able to catch over 50 fish in about four
hours of fishing. This method also helped catch some bigger fish. Pretty much every
fish we caught was around 12", but there was plenty that where around 15".
