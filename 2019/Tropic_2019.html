    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      The one time we fished Tropic the lake was about as full as it could get,
there was a lot of Rainbow, Tiger, and Brown Trout in the lake. The was also
extremely clear water, so spoons and spinners where our go to method. While we got a ton
of follows on a multitude of different spinners and spoons, we were pretty much
unable to produce a bite. We are not too sure why this was the case because we used a
bunch of different spoons and spinners, and retrieved them at different speeds, but where
still unable to catch them. It could have been that we were using the wrong method.
If this was the case, we would have had to have been close to being right going off
the amount of follows that we had. The spoons that caught the one fish for us was
a junior Kamlooper that is red, white, and gold.
