    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>
      In the spring the spoon fishing was very good at Lost Creek. The three best
spoons to use where Kamloopers, Pot-O-Golds, and Crocodiles. Of the three the
Kamloopers produced the most fish. The best colors to use where orange and gold
or yellow and gold in the standard size, and red, white, and gold in the junior
size. When retrieving the Kamloopers you would have to reel pretty slow, and sometimes
extremely slow in order to get the fish to bit. The reason the extremely slow
retrieve still worked with the Kamloopers was because you don't have to reel very
fast in order for them to get some nice side-to-side action on them. Which was
something the other two spoons didn't actieve as well. If the fish where a little
furious, which usually happened in the early mornings, then the other two spoons
worked well along with the Kamloopers. The best Pot-O-Gold color to use was red
and gold, and the best Crocodile color was silver. The Crocodile would really accell
if the fishing where very active, and hitting something that was moving fast because
that is how you would get the best motion out of it. The Pot-O-Gold was the worst
out of the three, but still worked very well. Using these spoons we where able to
catch 90 Trout in a morning of fishing.
