    <h1>Lost Creek Report 2019</h1>
    <h2>Statistics</h2>

    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>
      In the spring the spoon fishing was very good at Lost Creek. The three best
spoons to use where Kamloopers, Pot-O-Golds, and Crocodiles. Of the three the
Kamloopers produced the most fish. The best colors to use where orange and gold
or yellow and gold in the standard size, and red, white, and gold in the junior
size. When retrieving the Kamloopers you would have to reel pretty slow, and sometimes
extremely slow in order to get the fish to bite. The reason the extremely slow
retrieve still worked with the Kamloopers is because you don't have to reel very
fast in order for them to get some nice side-to-side action on them. Which was
something the other two spoons didn't achieve as well. If the fish where a little
more furious, which usually happened in the early mornings, then the other two spoons
worked well along with the Kamloopers. The best Pot-O-Gold color to use was red
and gold, and the best Crocodile color was silver. The Crocodile would really excel
if the fish where very active, and hitting something that was moving fast because
that is how you would get the best motion out of it. The Pot-O-Gold was the worst
out of the three, but still worked very well. Using these spoons, we were able to
catch 90 Trout in a morning of fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the spoon fishing ever died off, which sometimes happened in the late
mornings, then fishing on the bottom was the next best thing. The best bait to
use was half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 1 to 3-foot leader with a
standard sized water-bubble as the weight. If you don't know what a water-bubble
is please read the paragraph at the bottom of the page. When it came to casting
distance, it really depended on the day, so you would just have to experiment with
different distances until you found the right distance. While bottom fishing worked
well sometimes most of the time it was a very bad option due to the fact that most
of the fish where on the surface, so we only used it as a last resort if the spoon
bite was bad.
    </p>
    <h3>Summer</h3>
    <p>
      In the summer fishing from a boat was a better option then from shore due
to the fact that the fish would be deeper and farther out because of the warmer
temperatures. There were a few methods that worked. The first was jigging and trolling
2-inch tube jigs. The best colors to use where white and blue pearl pepper, which
is more like a translucent blue. We also tipped our tube jigs with Chub meat, but
you could use other baits and it would most likely work. We just strongly recommend
that you tip your jig with something to give it a little more sent and flavor.
Jigging worked best when it was calm. We recommend that you use electronics to find
a good concentration of fish to give you the best odds. The best places to find
large concentrations of fish were on ledges or steep drop-offs. If the wind picked
up you could still jig, but it would be much harder to stay on top of the fish,
or you could troll the tube jigs which worked but not as well as other methods
when it was windy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the wind picked up and trolling tube jigs wasn't working, then trolling
pop gear, dodgers, and triangle flashers with a worm would be the best option.
The best pop gear was silver willow leaf, the best flasher color was silver, and
With the dodger the best thing to do would be to make it a sling blade which is
basically, bending the front of it more so that it has a very intense side-to-side action
in the water. However, you don't want to have it spinning in the water if youâ€™re not
reeling it. Depending on what time of summer you were up there would depend on
how deep you would have to send your gear. In July most of the fish where 25-40
feet down, while in August most of them where 40-60 feet down. So, it would be
very likely that you would have to use extra weight or down riggers to get your
gear to the fish. We also recommend trolling at around 1 to 1.5 MPH. to get the most
action. We also recommend trolling trough the same areas that you used the tube
jigs because you already know there is a lot of fish there, and most likely there
would be more fish in nearby areas. When it was windy this was the best method
to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another method that sometimes worked in the early mornings while it was calm
would be casting small spoons like junior Kamloopers and Pot-O-Golds. The best
Kamlooper color was red, white, and gold while the best Pot-O-Gold color was red
and gold. This method rarely worked because the fish would rarely be on the surface,
and if they where they wouldn't be chasing spoons very well but it was still a fun
way to catch fish. It was just not going to produce near as much fish as the other
two methods.
