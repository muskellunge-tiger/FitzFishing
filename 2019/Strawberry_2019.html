    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>
      The one shore fishing trip we made to Strawberry in the spring was right
after ice off. While the fishing was a little slow there was quite a few methods
that produced some nice Rainbows and Cutthroats. The main thing that you would want
to look for was steep drop-offs near shore. The easiest way to do this is to look
for where the shore line is steep or on top of or around cliffs. The first method
we used was casting 2" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz. head tipped with Chub meat.
The retrieve that we used was a jig and reel down method. For an in-depth tutorial
on how to use this retrieve please read the casting section on tube jigs below.
While this method was not the best numbers producer it did produce the biggest fish
of the day, a 20" Cutthroat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second method that worked was casting large Lucky Craft minnowbaits near
the dam on the Solider Creek side of Strawberry. The retrieve that we used was a
stop and go retrieve, and most of the time the fish would hit right at shore after
your last crank. The only time this method would work is when we would see small
Chub swimming along the shore getting eaten by Cutthroats. This meant that you
would want your lure to look as close to a Chub as possible. The other thing to
watch would be how the Chub swam in the water, so you could as best you could
replicate that motion to increase your bites. This is why we used the stop and go
retrieve. If you didn't see Chub swimming around this method would most likely not
work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final method that worked was casting large spoons like Kamloopers and
Pot-O-Golds. The best colors to use where gold and silver. This method was best
to use around cliffs on the Solider Creek side when fish where hitting the surface.
When retrieving, you would want to just retrieve at a steady speed. This method
seemed to be the best way to catch Rainbows, and the Pot-O-Golds did better than
the Kamloopers.
    </p>
    <h3>Summer</h3>
    <h4>Kokanee</h4>
    <p>
      In 2019 the Kokanee fishing at Strawberry was decent. When trolling for them
we used pop gear and triangle flashers with a wedding ring or pink squid tipped
with a pink maggot. When it came to how far you put the lures behind the pop gear
or flashers for us it didn't really matter. Anything from 6" all the way to 3 feet
seemed to work. The best pop gear to use was silver or silver and gold willow leaf
or tomahawk bladed pop gear. The same colors worked with the flashers. The pop gear
was better than the flashers. The hardest part about catching the Kokanee was finding
what depth they were at, but once you found it you could catch quite a few of
them.
    </p>
    <h4>Cutthroat</h4>
    <p>
      Because the Cutthroat population is so strong in Strawberry, there is quite
a few ways to catch them throughout the year but in the summer, there are two
methods that work the best: trolling and tube jigs. Both of these methods are a
great way to catch a lot of Cutthroats in a day as long as you use the right gear
and the right methods. Both of these methods are capable of catching slot-buster
sized Cutthroats, and maybe the occasional Rainbow.
    </p>
    <h5>Trolling</h5>
    <p>
      When trolling for Cutthroats we find pop gear to be the best option, but
triangle flashers and dodgers also work well. The best pop gear to use is silver
willow leaf with half a worm anywhere from 6" to 3 feet behind the pop gear. The
biggest part of trolling for Cutthroats at Strawberry is making sure that your gear
is at the correct depth, and knowing what depth your pop gear runs at will really
help you out. For example, if you are trolling at 1 MPH. with no weight and 100
feet of line out then your gear is around 25 feet down, but the fish are only
really this deep in early summer and fall. The rest of the time they are deeper,
around 40+ feet, so you will need to add some weight. Remember that it doesn't
take much weight to get the gear deeper plus, the more weight you have the harder
it's going to be to reel especially if you are using pop gear with a lot of blades.
Now, if you have down riggers then you don't need to worry about adding weight,
just simply put your down rigger to the depth the fish are coming through at.
    </p>
    <h5>Tube jigs</h5>
    <p>
      While trolling can be a great option for catch Cutthroats, using 2-3" white
tube jigs with 3/8oz heads are probably the single best option for if you want to
catch a massive amount of fish in a very short amount of time. This works especially
well when it is calm which it usually is every morning at Strawberry. There are
a couple of ways to use tube jigs, and catch a large amount of fish at Strawberry
and they are jigging, cast, and drift trolling. When using any of these strategies
I strongly recommend that you tip your jig with Chub meat. Reason for this is
because the main food source for Cutthroats in Strawberry is Chub, so having this
will give fantastic success.
    </p>
    <h6>Jigging</h6>
    <p>
      When jigging tube jigs, it is very important that you have a fish finder with
you, so you can see where the fish are and where you jig is. The thing to do while
jigging is to drop your jig down to the depth that the fish are coming through the
most often. Depending on the time of year it is will determine how deep the fish
are. A good general depth to look for is around 40 to 50 feet as the fish are
around that depth quite often. When a fish does come through if you have an advanced
fish finder you want to watch the behavior of the fish when it is looking at your
jig. Watch to see what happens when you jig, and if the fish follows it up and back
down repeat your jigs a couple of times then dead stick it for a few seconds, and
usually the fish will hit right away. If the fish doesn't follow your jig
aggressively or not at all, then just simply dead stick your jig, and wait to see
if the fish will hit your jig, which they usually will. If you do set the hook,
but miss them drop your tip back down without reeling, and if your line slacks off
or the jig doesn't sink and you're not on the bottom. This means the fish has
grabbed your jig, so just reel the slack up and set the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      This method is best to use when it is calm, and the boat is not moving or
moving much. The reason is because it is easier to see your jig on the fish finder,
and it is easier to drop down to the depth the fish are at and stay there. If it
is ever windy, but you still want to jig then use the drift trolling method.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h6>Casting</h6>
    <p>
      Casting tube jigs is probably my most favorite thing to do at Strawberry in
the summer months. While the strategy that we are about to go over might be hard
to understand in words, I have provided a video at the end of the strategies to
show you what I'm talking about in action. Also know that this may take some time
to get good at if you are not used to casting and jigging tube jigs at the same time,
but with the right amount of practice you should be able to get the hang of it
pretty quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using this method start by casting your tube jig out as far as you can,
and then just leave your bail open to let the tube jig sink to where you see the
fish coming through on your fish finder. Now this may be hard to judge at the start,
but once you catch a few fish your brain will subconsciously know how long
you need to let your jig sink. Once you are down in the range the fish are at
reel up any slack in your line, and then do a somewhat hard vertical jig, then reel
down and repeat. Do this through the whole cast. At some point while doing this
you will go to jig, and there will be a major weight difference, it is at this point
that you set the hook. If you ever hook and miss, which you will, just lower your
rod without reeling to let the jig sink. While doing this if you ever see your line
slack off, and you know you are not hitting the bottom, reel up the slack and set the
hook because what will happen is, the Cutthroat will grab the jig while it is sinking
which will cause your line to slack. If the fish doesn't hit it when you do this
continue the jigging process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your jig has come back into view, stop jigging and let the jig sink for
a few seconds. The reason for this is because the Cutthroats will usually follow the jig
all the way in and then hit it, but you might not see them when they hit it even though
you can see your jig. This is due to the fact that Cutthroats can sometimes blend
in with the water making it hard to see them. To tell if a Cutthroat has hit, just
watch the jig to see if it makes an unusual movement rather than just straight down,
or see if some of the jig seems to disappear. If this happens don't set the hook
right away, instead give it a second or two, and then set the hook to ensure that
the fish actually has a chance to eat the jig a little. If you see the fish hit the
jig, again don't set the hook right away, just wait a second or two then set. Now,
it is very easy to tell if the fish has eaten your jig enough if you can see them
hit it. If you see that they have the whole back half of the jig this means they
have the hook in their mouth, so set the hook. If they just grab the head then
they don't have the hook, but sometimes if you wait a few seconds they will re-adjust
there bit, and get the hook. But if this never happens it is still a good idea to
set the hook to make the fish think the jig is trying to escape. If you do this
most of the time the fish will circle back around, and hit again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If at any time you hook a fish reel it in a little, but then loose it, don't
give up. Sometimes the fish, even though they were hooked, will still come back and
continue to bite your jig. To prove that this can actually happen I have provided a
video at the end of the strategies showing this happening. I highly recommend that
you take the time to practice this method because it will pay off. It only took
me a day to get it pretty well figured out, and after a few days of doing this I
was hooking fish more often than I would lose them, and now that I have done this
for a second year, most of the time I'm losing very little fish. Also remember that
depending on the time of year it is might change how fast you jig your jig. Generally
the speed shown in the video is good, but sometimes if the water is around 70
degrees a slower jig with be need because the fish are not as active.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h6>Drift Trolling/Jigging</h6>
    <p>
      Sometimes when the wind picks up at Strawberry it's still okay to use tube
jigs. However, vertically jigging them is now much harder because the boat is drifting
with the wind. Lucky, there is a method that we started using this year that allowed
us to still catch fish jigging even when it was windy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before trying this method, you will need a fish finder so you can see your
jig and what depth the fish are at. The first thing you need to know is that this
method only works well if you are in an area with a high concentration of fish.
This is not too hard to figure out if you have a fish finder. If you are seeing a
lot of fish coming through as you drift then this is where this method will shine.
If you don't see many or any fish coming through then this method will not be the
best thing to use in that area. However, if you want to use it then you just have
to go find an area with a lot of fish in it.

      Once you are in an area with a lot of fish, the first thing you want to do
is drop your jig off the side of the boat that is going with the wind. This means
that when you drop your jig it will go under the boat. This is also easiest to do
in the back of the boat, so you can get your rod to the other side easier. Just
make sure you watch out for your out-drive. If you drop your jig fast enough then
you will be able to briefly see it dropping allowing you to put it right on the
fish. More often than not if there are fish on the fish finder as your jig is
dropping they will start to come up after it, but the most important thing to remember
here is to not stop dropping. You want to stop dropping when your jig line and the
fish line come together. This will also cause the jig to fall past them which for
some reason makes them really aggressive towards it, so you will likely get a bite
as you are switching sides of the boat. If they don't hit it right away, just give
it a jig or two and they will likely hit it. They may also only nip at it, so it
may take quite a few tries to hook them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you drop down while there is no fish coming through or the fish don't bite
right away. Just let your jig drift for a little bit, and sometimes you will get
a bite. If it's been a minute or two and you haven't gotten a bite then your jig
has likely drifted out of the depth range the fish are at due to the wind. The best
thing to do here is to let out some more line then retrieve the jig using the casting retrieve
talked about in the casting section. Doing this has a great chance of you catching
a fish. Another thing that is possible to do, but that is more advanced is to
intercept fish that are coming through after you have dropped down and drifted the
jig for a while. The way you do this is, let out more line just like you normally
would to get your jig deeper. Except this time wait for the fish to move down the
chart a little bit then begin to jig up. This will most likely get you a bite, but
it requires a little bit of practice figuring out have far down your chart you
need to let the fish go. This distance will change depending on your chart speed
and wind speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final method you can use here is, simply dropping your jig down to the
depth that you see the fish coming through most often, and just letting the jig
drift. While this is not the most effective method it can be good to use if you
are doing something else or getting something else ready. We most commonly use
this method at lunch time. The other time this method could be good to use is when
you are trying to find a larger concentration of fish as it will keep a lure in
the water still giving you that chance to catch a fish.

      While all of these tube jig strategies will catch you Cutthroat 95% of the time,
  it is still possible to catch Rainbows while doing these. This is most likely to
  happen when using the casting strategy, but it can still happen with the other two. If
  you are really luck you may be able to hook a very large Kokanee, but this is extremely
  unlikely. Of the hundreds of time I have casted tube jigs, and the hundreds of fish
  I have caught doing it only one time did I hook a Kokanee. Unfortunately, I didn't
  catch it, but it was really cool just to feel how a Kokanee hits a lure while not
  trolling. So, just know that if you use any of these methods you will almost always
  catch Cutthroats with maybe the occasional Rainbow or Kokanee mixed in.

    <h3>Fall</h3>
    <p>
      While fishing at Strawberry in the fall can be very cold, it can be some of
the best fishing all year. Depending on what time of fall it is will usually determine
what the best method to use is. One of the biggest things to remember is that if
you are doing things right you can fish out an area in about an hour or two, so
it's important to remember that if you are not catching or seeing any fish that
you move to a different area in order to start catching again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In early to mid-fall the fish are usually extremely active on the surface.
This means that the spoon fishing can be about as good as it gets, but Lucky Craft
115s can also be a great option. Because of the time of year, the fish are usually
after larger baits, so using bigger spoons is the best option and also why the
larger Lucky Crafts work too. This year the best color for spoons was orange, but
other colors like yellow, red, and Rainbow patterned work good as well. When it
came to retrieving the spoons, in the early mornings you would sometimes have to
let the spoon sink a little bit in order to catch fish because they weren't right
on the surface yet. After the sun had been up for a little bit the fish would be
right on the surface feeding, so letting the spoon sink was not needed anymore.
When came to retrieve speed a good steady retrieve did the trick. When it came to
the Lucky Craft using the same stop and go retrieve mentioned in the spring section
worked the best. The Lucky Crafts also caught the biggest fish for us out of Strawberry
in 2019. A 23" Cutthroat, and the spoons also caught a slot-buster Cutthroat as
well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fishing with these spoons and Lucky Crafts don't only work in the fall. They
can also work in the mornings in early summer if you see fish breaking the surface.
In my opion this is one of the best methods to use at Strawberry and is probably
the fastest way to catch fish. The two trips we made in October where we used the
spoons and Lucky Crafts we caught a total of 130 fish in about 6 to 7 hours each
day, and that includes the dead times where we had  to go find more fish after
fishing a spot out very quickly. So, I believe it is more than likely to catch
over 100 fish in one day using these lures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In late fall when the water is starting to get pretty cold the spoon and
Lucky Craft fishing can be pretty bad. This is when casting and jigging tube jigs
using the same casting and jigging methods discussed in the summer section comes
in to play. Because Strawberry can be calm pretty much all day in the fall you
don't need to really worry about the drifting method, but it's good to have it in
mind if the wind does pick up. However, unlike summer you want to use bigger tube
jigs, 2.5 to 4". The color and bait on the jig don't really need to change though.
The fish will also be pretty shallow, but suspended over deeper water. A good
depth to look for would be around 40 feet. Because the fish where shallow it meant
that sometimes you would have to let your jig sink much, and sometimes using a
horizontal pop, like using a jerkbait, rather than a vertical jig worked better
because it increased the speed of the jig. If you were using 4" jigs it would
sometimes be a good idea to add a "stinger hook" in the tentacles of the jig, so
that if the fish nipped at the tentacles you would still hook them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using tube jigs in late fall will usually catch you more fish than in the
summer because the fish are hungry more often, and are sometimes in bigger schools.
The one trip we made in November using tube jigs we caught 82 fish in one day which
is currently our best single day number at Strawberry.

    <h3>Ice Fishing</h3>
    <p>
      At the beginning of 2019 the snow and slush made it very hard to walk if you
didn't have snow shoes, and there was about 3 feet between all the snow, slush,
and ice before you got to the water, so it would take a while to drill holes.
In fact, the snow got so bad that the access road to the marina had to be closed
in the middle of March. However, through all of that the fishing was pretty good most of
the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the most part the best depth to look for was around 40 to 50 feet. Most
of the fish would come through at around 20 to 35 feet, but there were a few that
would come through high in the water. Most of the time 2" white tube jigs
tipped with Chub meat were good at catching the deeper fish. However, for the higher
fish in the water, smaller tube jigs tipped with either worm, wax worm, or pink
maggots worked. The best colors to use for the smaller tube jigs where green, white,
and yellow. Using these smaller tube jigs, we were able to catch quite a few
Cutthroats, a small Kokanee, and a 23" 4-pound Rainbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new method that we started using in 2019 ice fishing was, using a dodger
with a small tube jig around 1.5 to 2 feet below the dodger. The dodger we used
was one that would glow when hit with UV light. We tipped the small jigs with either
Chub meat, worms, or pink maggots. This method proved to be a very good one because
the dodger does a great job at bring fish in because of the glow, flash, and vibration
it releases in the water. Just remember that the dodger will not sink straight
down like a jig, so be careful that you don't tangle other lines as it sinks. This
is also peoples preferred method of catching Kokanee through the ice. Unfortunately,
we were unable to catch any Kokanee using this method, but we did catch quite a
few Cutthroats.
