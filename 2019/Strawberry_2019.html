    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>
      The one shore fishing trip we made to Strawberry in the spring was right
after ice off. While the fishing was a little slow there was quite a few methods
that produced some nice Rainbows and Cutthroats. The main thing that you would want
to look for was steep drop-offs near shore. The easiest way to do this is to look
for where the shore line is steep or on top of or around cliffs. The first method
we used was casting 2" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz. head. The retrieve that we
used was a jig and reel down method. For an in-depth tutorial on how to use this
retrieve please read the casting section on tube jigs below. While this method was
not the best numbers producer it did produce the biggest fish of the day, a 20"
Cutthroat.
