    <h1>Strawberry Report 2019</h1>
    <h2>Statistics</h2>

    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>
      The one shore fishing trip we made to Strawberry in the spring was right
after ice off. While the fishing was a little slow there was quite a few methods
that produced some nice Rainbows and Cutthroats. The main thing that you would want
to look for was steep drop-offs near shore. The easiest way to do this is to look
for where the shore line is steep or on top of or around cliffs. The first method
we used was casting 2" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz. head tipped with Chub meat.
The retrieve that we used was a jig and reel down method. For an in-depth tutorial
on how to use this retrieve please read the casting section on tube jigs below.
While this method was not the best numbers producer it did produce the biggest fish
of the day, a 20" Cutthroat.

      The second method that worked was casting large Lucky Craft minnowbaits near
the dam on the Solider Creek side of Strawberry. The retrieve that we used was a
stop and go retrieve, and most of the time the fish would hit right at shore after
your last crank. The only time this method would work is when we would see small
Chub swimming along the shore getting eaten by Cutthroats. This meant that you
would want your lure to look as close to a Chub as possible. The other thing to
watch would be how the Chub swam in the water, so you could as best you could
replicate that motion to increase your bites. This is why we used the stop and go
retrieve. If you didn't see Chub swimming around this method would most likely not
work.

      The final method that worked was casting large spoons like Kamloopers and
Pot-O-Golds. The best colors to use where gold and silver. This method was best
to use around cliffs on the Solider Creek side when fish where hitting the surface.
When retrieving, you would want to just retrieve at a steady speed. This method
seemed to be the best way to catch Rainbows, and the Pot-O-Golds did better than
the Kamloopers.

    <h3>Summer</h3>
    <h4>Kokanee</h4>
    <p>
      In 2019 the Kokanee fishing at Strawberry was decent. When trolling for them
we used pop gear and triangle flashers with a wedding ring or pink squid tipped
with a pink maggot. When it came to how far you put the lures behind the pop gear
or flashers for us it didn't really matter. Anything from 6" all the way to 3 feet
seemed to work. The best pop gear to use was silver or silver and gold willow leaf
or tomahawk bladed pop gear. The same colors worked with the flashers. The pop gear
was better than the flashers. The hardest part about catching the Kokanee was finding
what depth they were at, but once you found it you could catch quite a few of
them.
