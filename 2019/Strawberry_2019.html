    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <p>
      The one shore fishing trip we made to Strawberry in the spring was right
after ice off. While the fishing was a little slow there was quite a few methods
that produced some nice Rainbows and Cutthroats. The main thing that you would want
to look for was steep drop-offs near shore. The easiest way to do this is to look
for where the shore line is steep or on top of or around cliffs. The first method
we used was casting 2" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz. head tipped with Chub meat.
The retrieve that we used was a jig and reel down method. For an in-depth tutorial
on how to use this retrieve please read the casting section on tube jigs below.
While this method was not the best numbers producer it did produce the biggest fish
of the day, a 20" Cutthroat.

      The second method that worked was casting large Lucky Craft minnowbaits near
the dam on the Solider Creek side of Strawberry. The retrieve that we used was a
stop and go retrieve, and most of the time the fish would hit right at shore after
your last crank. The only time this method would work is when we would see small
Chub swimming along the shore getting eaten by Cutthroats. This meant that you
would want your lure to look as close to a Chub as possible. The other thing to
watch would be how the Chub swam in the water, so you could as best you could
replicate that motion to increase your bites. This is why we used the stop and go
retrieve. If you didn't see Chub swimming around this method would most likely not
work.
