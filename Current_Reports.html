    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    Water temperature is around 40 degrees, and fishing is fast. The best lures
to use are 2.5 to 4" tube jigs. The best color for us was white. We recommend that
you tip your tube jigs with Chub meat. The best methods to use are jigging and
casting using a jig up and reel down method. Most of the fish are in shallow water,
but there are some deeper fish. A good depth to look for is 40 feet. Most of the
fish are around 17 inches. <strong>(Report from: 11/9/19)</strong>

  <h3>Good Ski</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is pretty good. There is a lot of fish on the surface, so fishing spoons
and spinners works very well. The spoon we found to work the best was a fire tiger
Daredevil, and the best spinner was a green Jake. While spoons and spinners will
catch you a lot of fish, fishing a tube jig tipped with a pink maggot will get you
a ton of bites. The best tube jig to use is a 1.5" orange tube jig with a lighter
jig head inside. You will want to fish this using a bottom bouncing method, or a
slow retrieve method. Most of the fish are in the 12" range.

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is good from the shore. The best method to use is casting 2 to 2.5"
white or translucent blue tube jigs tipped with chub meat using a jig and reel
method. In the mornings you don't need to let the tube jig sink very far, but in
the late mornings you will need to let the jig sink a bit farther. Another method
that works if the tube jigs aren't working is fishing half a worm and half a
marshmallow on the bottom with a 2 to 3 foot leader. You won't need to cast your
bottom gear out to far because the fish are in close due to cooler water temperatures.

  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is still okay. There is a lot of surface activity, but there not hitting
good with spoons or spinners. The tube jig fishing is no longer good, so the only
way to catch fish is trolling pop gear or dodgers with a worm. Most of the fish
are around 6-12 inches with a few bigger ones here and there. <strong>(Report from: 10/26/19)</strong>
