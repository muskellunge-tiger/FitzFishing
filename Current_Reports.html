    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    Due to a recent stocking of Trout, the fishing is very good. The two best
methods to use are fishing on the bottom with half a worm and half a marshmallow
and fishing with a small yellow Atomic tube tipped with a pink maggot. Another
method that kind of works is fishing with a red gold and white junior Kamlooper,
but because it is still a little early in the year it is not the best option at
this time. When fishing with the tube jig you either want to retrieve it slowly
or cast it out and let it rest on the bottom. However, if you don't get a bite
within a minute or two then slowly retrieve it and cast it back out. If you find an
area with a lot of fish in it then this bottom tube jig fishing with get you a bite
pretty much every cast. <strong>(Report from: 3/5/20)</strong>

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    There is very little slush on the lake, and only a couple of inches of snow.
The fishing is pretty good right now, in about 50 to 60 feet of water. The best
lures to use are 2 to 3" white tube jigs and orange or white Marabou's. When using
the white tube jigs we recommend that you add a "stinger hook" to it because of
the fact that the fish sometimes nip at the tail of the jig. We also recommend
that you tip all your jigs with some sort of bait. The bait we used was a piece
of Chub meat. <strong>(Report from: 3/3/20)</strong>

  <h3>Good Ski Lake</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is starting to pick up even more now that the pond has been unfrozen
for a couple more days. There are 2 really good methods to use they are: bottom
fishing and fishing with 1.5-2” tube jigs or 1” Marabou's. When bottom fishing the best bait
to use is half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 6" leader. When fishing
tube jigs the best colors to use are yellow and orange, but other colors like green
and white will also likely work. When using Marabou’s, the best color is green and
white. We recommend that you tip you jigs with some kind of bait, we used pink
maggots, to increase bites. When fishing the jigs, it is best to either bottom
bounce or cast them out about 15 to 20 feet and just let it sit on the bottom. If
you are in an area that has a lot of fish then this method will sometimes get you
bites the second the jig hits the bottom. If that doesn't happen then within about
a minute you will get bit. If your jig is sitting for more than a couple of minutes
without a bite then recast it in a different area or try bottom bouncing to cover
more area till you find them. <strong>(Report from: 2/26/20)</strong>
