    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is still good from shore, but is slowing down most likely due to the
temperatures getting colder. The bite on artificial lures has pretty much stopped.
You can still catch a few fish with a tube jig. The best methods to use are worm
with a bobber on about a 2 to 3-foot leader or half a worm and half a marshmallow on
the bottom. Most of the fish are around 15 inches long. <strong>(Report from: 11/24/19)</strong>

  <h3>Good Ski</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is great with tube jigs. You will want to use 1.5" orange, yellow, or
white tube jigs tipped with a pink maggot. You also want to use a lighter jig head
with a longer hook, so it sinks slower and so you have a better hookup chance. The
best method to catch them is using a bottom bouncing method. Most of the fish are
around 12", but there is plenty of 13-15 inchers as well.
