    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    The water temperature  is 52 degrees, and there is quite a bit of algae throughout
the lake. However, this is not hindering the fish because the bit is hot. The lures
to use are big spoons and big jerkbaits or minnowbaits. The best color for spoons
is orange, but other colors like yellow, red, or rainbow pattern also work. Lucky
Craft 115s that are patterned like Chub will get you a lot of bigger fish. The best
way to trigger a bite with the Lucky Crafts is to use a stop and go retrieve. Most
of the fish are around 12-14 inches, but there is plenty of 16-18 inchers and occasionally
there is a slot buster within those smaller fish. <strong>(Report from: 10/5/19)</strong>

  <h3>Rockport</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is great, and the water clarity is also quite good. There is a lot of
algae in the water, but it doesn't seem to hinder the fish's activity. Most of the
fish are on or very near the surface, so the spinner and spoon fishing is amazing.
The best spoons to use are Perch patterned Thunder Bolts or silver and green Pot-O-Golds.
Other spoons that work are yellow Kamloopers, fire tiger Daredevils, and gold
Castmasters. While the best way to catch them is casting, if you are having trouble
getting bites, trolling the spoons is a great way to catch and find where the fish
are at. We found that tube jigs and small swimbaits did not work. Most of the fish
are 13-15", but there are a few bigger and smaller ones around. <strong>(Report from: 10/2/19)</strong>

  <h3>Good Ski Lake</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is great thanks to a recent stocking of 2600 Rainbows. Water clarity
is pretty good but not great. The best lures to use are green Jakes or a fire tiger
Daredevil spoon. Kamloopers work and will catch fish, but not to the extent that
the Jakes and the Daredevils do. <strong>(Report from: 10/1/19)</strong>

  <h3>Adams</h3>
  <p>
    Due to a recnet stocking the fishing has picked up. Fishing Kamloopers or junior
Kamloopers is the way to go. The best colors to use are red, gold, and white or
yellow and gold. Orange and gold my also work, but due to the fact that the water
is no super clear it doesn't do as good as the other colors. <strong>(Report from: 9/26/19)</strong>
