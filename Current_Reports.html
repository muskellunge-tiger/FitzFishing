    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    Fishing is fair right now. What we found was that slightly deeper depths was
the way to go. The depth that we fished at was around 55 feet. While there was a
lot of fish coming through on the bottom, it was hard at times to get them to bite.
However, if fish came through higher in the water column then it would be a lot
easier to get them to bite. The be lures to use are 2 to 3" white or pearl tube
jigs tipped with Chub. We also added a "stinger hook" because the fish tend to
bite the tails. Marabou's also work well especially for fish that come through
at around 15 feet. <strong>(Report from: 2/16/20)</strong>

    Fishing is really good right now; most methods work as long as they don't
require a fast retrieve because it is still a little too cold for spoons and spinners
to work. However, this does not mean that they won't work. It just means that they
won't work as well as other methods at this time. The best method to use is bottom
fishing either half a worm and half a marshmallow, chartreuse green powerbait, rainbow
Trout nuggets, or just a whole marshmallow. The leader length that works the best
for us is a 6" leader, but a longer leader will likely work too. Another method
that works is either slowly reeling in or bottom bouncing tube jigs or Marabou's.
The best color for tube jigs is orange or white, and the best Marabou color for
us was a white and green Marabou. We recommend that you tip your jigs with some
sort of bait. The bait we used was pink maggots, but worms or corn will also likely
work. <strong>(Report from: 2/2/20)</strong>
