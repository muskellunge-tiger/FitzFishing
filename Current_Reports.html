    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    The pond was recently stocked with small Rainbow Trout. Most of the trout
are on the surface, and water clarity is pretty good. This makes the spinner fishing
good. The best lures to use are: small Jakes, junior Kamloopers, and small roaster
tail spinners. Most of the trout are 6-9 inches, but there are a few bigger ones
around. <strong>(Report from: 9/25/19)</strong>

    Fishing is still slow. However, there is a lot of surface activity from small
Bluegill and Bass in close while the trout tend to mostly be farther out, but a
few will sometimes come in close. Water clearly is not very good right now, but
we hope it will get better in the coming weeks. <strong>(Report from: 9/19/19)</strong>

    Fishing is very slow right now mostly likely due to the warm temperatures.
We think in around a week or two the fishing will pick-up. <strong>(Report from: 9/12/19)</strong>
