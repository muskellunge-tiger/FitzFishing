    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Adams</h3>
  <p>
    There is a fair number of algae, but the water is clear. There multiple 16-20"
Rainbow swimming along the shore and some smaller farther out. Fishing is slow. Fishing
on bottom will most likely give success on the docks, and fishing with spinners will
also work. The best spinners we found work where Kamloopers and Jake. We also multiple
fish to follow small lipless crankbaits. <strong>(Report from: 4/25/19)</strong>

  <h3>Jensen</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is very slow. Fishing on the bottom with corn and half a marshmallow
might get you some bites. For us, fishing a green Jake was the best. <strong>(Report from: 4/25/19)</strong>

  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    The fishing is slow. There are quite a few fish breaking the surface, but we
where unable to catch any of these fish. We tried small spoons, spinners, green tube
jigs, and half a worm below a bobber with no luck. We did catch 2 very nice Rainbows,
around 20", and had a few other small bites using half a worm and half a marshmallow
on the bottom. <strong>(Report from: 4/23/19)</strong>

  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    The lake is ice free, and fish are active on the surface. However, we where
unable to catch any fish on spinners, spoons, tube jigs, or flies. The bite was good on
the bottom with half a worm and half a marshmallow. Fishing a bobber with half a
worm about 3 feet below the bobber also worked. Most of the fish are 12 to 13 inches
with a few larger here and there. <strong>(Report from: 4/19/19)</strong>

  <h3>Holmes</h3>
  <p>
    After a recent stocking of another 1,700 fish the fishing is getting really
good. Fishing with spoons is what we found to be the best option. Try using spoons
like Kamloopers or Pot-O-Golds. The best colors are red, white, and gold. The fishing
is best in the morning and early afternoon before it dies off in the middle of the
day. <strong>(Report from: 4/13/19)</strong>
