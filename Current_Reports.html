    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is starting to slow down from shore. It seems the only way to catch
any fish is to use Kamlooper spoons with the best colors being red and gold or
yellow and gold. Make sure to retrieve slowly. Most of the fish are very small
Rainbows, but there is the occasional Cutthroat, Tiger, and bigger Rainbows.

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    The lake is ice free, and the water is fairly clear. Fishing from shore is slowing
down, but you are still able to catch nice Rainbows and Cutts. Try to steep drop
offs near shore, lake the dam on the Soldier Creek side. Fishing white tub jigs
with a 3/8oz. head tipped with chub meat will get a few bites. Large silver or
gold spoons like Kamloopers and Pot-o-Golds will catch good sized Rainbows and Cutts
at a pretty good rate. If you see small chub swimming near the shore that are being
attacked by Cutthroats, use large Lucky Craft minnowbaits. Bait fishing for
us was not working at all. <strong>(Report from: 5/13/19)</strong>
