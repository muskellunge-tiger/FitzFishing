    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Adams</h3>
  <p>
    Adams was recently stocked with planter sized Rainbows. The fishing is still
a little slow with spinners, and the pond is at max water capacity. We think that
in the near future the fishing will get better. <strong>(Report from: 4/1/19)</strong>

  <h3>Holmes</h3>
  <p>
    The fishing is getting fast after the recent stocking. Most fishing methods
will catch fish. We found that fishing with a small red and white Kamlooper worked
very well for fish on the surface. If you are fly fishing you will need to get your
fly out a long way, or get in pontoon boat to be successful. We also saw other
people catch stuff bottom fishing. All around the fishing is great. <strong>(Report from: 4/1/19)</strong>

  <h3>Jensen</h3>
  <p>
    There is a good amount of fish in the pond due to recent stocking. Fish are
mainly hitting on the bottom. Try using worm and a marshmallow or corn and a marshmallow.
Occasionally a fish will hit a spinner on the surface, but it is very unlikely.
The Pelicans and ducks are also a problem because they cause some much chaos on the
surface that it scares the fish off. <strong>(Report from: 3/25/19)</strong>

  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing has really slowed over the past few days. The possible reason for this
might be due to the crowds from last weekend catching, and taking a lot of the fish
out of the pond. Fishing a green tube jig with pink maggots still work occasionally,
and there is still a decent amount of 18-22" Rainbow Trout in the pond, but there
is not near as many as there where the week before. I suggest that you wait for
the pond to be re-stocked if you want to get on a good bite. <strong>(Report from: 3/19/19)</strong>
