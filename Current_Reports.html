    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    The ponds are free of ice, and fishing is great. Pretty much any method works
whether it be casting jigs, fishing on the bottom, fly fishing, etc. you have a
good chance of getting a fish. We found that fishing a small green tube jig tipped
with Berkley Gulp pink maggots worked well when casting with a slow retrieve. Bottom
fishing half a worm and marshmallow also worked great. Most of the trout are around
10-12", with the occasional 20 incher.

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    Between the ice and snow there is around 2 feet before you get to the water.
Fish mainly come through at around 35-40 feet of water with the occasional high
flyer about 15-20 feet below the ice. Fishing dodgers with jig around 1.5-2 feet
below the dodger is a great way to catch and bring fish in. Smaller tube jigs also
work well with the best colors being green or white. Tipping your jigs with Chub
meat or worms will up your chances at getting a better bite. <strong>(Report from: 2/26/19)</strong>

  <h3>Jensen</h3>
  <p>
    Jensen is completely clear of ice. Fishing is still kind of slow, but is getting
better now that the pond is unfrozen. Fishing on the bottom with half a marshmallow
and corn was the best method. We only saw people catching fish on the bottom, and
none when casting lures. We did get a few hits on lures, but the bottom fishing
was a lot better. <strong>(Report from: 2/17/19)</strong>
