    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    Fishing is really good right now; most methods work as long as they don't
require a fast retrieve because it is still a little too cold for spoons and spinners
to work. However, this does not mean that they won't work. It just means that they
won't work as well as other methods at this time. The best method to use is bottom
fishing either half a worm and half a marshmallow, chartreuse green powerbait, rainbow
Trout nuggets, or just a whole marshmallow. The leader length that works the best
for us is a 6" leader, but a longer leader will likely work too. Another method
that works is either slowly reeling in or bottom bouncing tube jigs or Marabou's.
The best color for tube jigs is orange or white, and the best Marabou color for
us was a white and green Marabou. We recommend that you tip your jigs with some
sort of bait. The bait we used was pink maggots, but worms or corn will also likely
work. <strong>(Report from: 2/2/20)</strong>

    While there is a fair amount of slush on the lake, most of it has hardened,
but slush conditions constantly change so this may not be the case in a day or
two. As the fishing goes, it has slowed a little bit. The best depth for us was
around 35 to 45 feet. The best jig to use for deeper fish is a 2 to 3-inch white
tube jig tipped with Chub. We also recommend that you add a "stinger hook" to your
tube jig because the fish tend to just nip at the tails of the jigs, so this
will give you a better chance at hooking up. For higher flying fish, it is best
to use Marabou's. The specific color that we used was orange, but we have had success
with green and white as well. <strong>(Report from: 2/1/20)</strong>
