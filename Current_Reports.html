    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is still decent from the shore. There is a lot of fish up shallow in
the morning, but then they go deeper in the early afternoon. Fishing 2-2.5 inch
tube jigs, preferably white or translucent blue pepper tipped with Chub meat
or worm, is a great way to catch fish. Fishing on the bottom with half a worm and
half a marshmallow is also a good way to catch fish. Just remember to cast your
bottom gear shorter in the morning, but farther in the afternoon. Fishing a bobber
with a whole worm on about a 3-foot leader is also a great way to catch fish. Most
of the fish are around 14 to 15 inches. <strong>(Report from: 11/17/19)</strong>

  <h3>Good Ski</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is great with tube jigs. You will want to use 1.5" orange, yellow, or
white tube jigs tipped with a pink maggot. You also want to use a lighter jig head
with a longer hook, so it sinks slower and so you have a better hookup chance. The
best method to catch them is using a bottom bouncing method. Most of the fish are
around 12", but there is plenty of 13-15 inchers as well.

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    Water temperature is around 40 degrees, and fishing is fast. The best lures
to use are 2.5 to 4" tube jigs. The best color for us was white. We recommend that
you tip your tube jigs with Chub meat. The best methods to use are jigging and
casting using a jig up and reel down method. Most of the fish are in shallow water,
but there are some deeper fish. A good depth to look for is 40 feet. Most of the
fish are around 17 inches. <strong>(Report from: 11/9/19)</strong>
