    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Tropic</h3>
  <p>
    The is about as full as it can get, and has a ton of little Rainbows, Tigers,
Browns. The water is very clear, so it is perfect for spinner and spoon fishing.
However, even though you can get a ton of followers the fish just almost never bite.
Because if this the fishing is very slow. <strong>(Report from: 6/18/19)</strong>

  <h3>Rockport</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is good for Trout on the south end of the lake, but very slow on the
north end. Trolling silver and gold 4 to 6 blade willow leaf pop gear at around 1
mph. 100 feet behind the boat does pretty good. If you see a decent number of fish
breaking the surface then casting perch pattern spoons can get you a few extra bites.
The water temp is in the high 50s. Most of the fish are around 15 inches. <strong>(Report from: 6/5/19)</strong>

  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    The reservoir is full and the fishing is hot. Water temp in the morning is
around 55 degrees, and warms up to around 59 degrees in the afternoon. Trolling
pop gear without weight 100 feet behind the boat at around 1 mph. is the best way
to catch fish right now. The best pop gear for us was, 4 bladed silver or gold
willow leaf. Triangle gold, silver, and green flashers also worked. We tried casting
spoons, crankbaits, and jigs but had no luck. Most of the fish where 13 to 16 inches
with a few smaller and bigger ones. <strong>(Report from: 6/3/19)</strong>
