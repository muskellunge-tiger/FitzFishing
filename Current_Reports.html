    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Good Ski Lake</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is starting to pick up even more now that the pond has been unfrozen
for a couple more days. There are 2 really good methods to use they are: bottom
fishing and fishing with 1.5-2” tube jigs or 1” Marabou's. When bottom fishing the best bait
to use is half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 6" leader. When fishing
tube jigs the best colors to use are yellow and orange, but other colors like green
and white will also likely work. When using Marabou’s, the best color is green and
white. We recommend that you tip you jigs with some kind of bait, we used pink
maggots, to increase bites. When fishing the jigs, it is best to either bottom
bounce or cast them out about 15 to 20 feet and just let it sit on the bottom. If
you are in an area that has a lot of fish then this method will sometimes get you
bites the second the jig hits the bottom. If that doesn't happen then within about
a minute you will get bit. If your jig is sitting for more than a couple of minutes
without a bite then recast it in a different area or try bottom bouncing to cover
more area till you find them. <strong>(Report from: 2/26/20)</strong>

  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    The ponds are full, ice free, and the fishing is fast right now. The best lure
to use is a small yellow Atomic tube jig using a slow retrieve method. This lure
works so well that it doesn't require being tipped with bait most of the time to
catch fish. However, if you aren't getting any bites then tipping you jig with pink
maggots is a good idea. Another method that worked if the tube jig wasn't working
was bottom fishing half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 6" leader.

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is fair right now. What we found was that slightly deeper depths was
the way to go. The depth that we fished at was around 55 feet. While there was a
lot of fish coming through on the bottom, it was hard at times to get them to bite.
However, if fish came through higher in the water column then it would be a lot
easier to get them to bite. The be lures to use are 2 to 3" white or pearl tube
jigs tipped with Chub. We also added a "stinger hook" because the fish tend to
bite the tails. Marabou's also work well especially for fish that come through
at around 15 feet. <strong>(Report from: 2/16/20)</strong>
