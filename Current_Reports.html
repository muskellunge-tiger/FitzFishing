    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    Water temperature is in the high 60s, and the fishing is fairly slow except
for the early mornings. Casting and trolling yellow and gold Kamloopers is a good
method early on when the fish are near the surface. In the late morning trolling
silver willow leaf pop gear with a worm around 20-25 feet down at around 1.0 to
1.5 mph. is the best option. Trolling silver triangle flashers with a worm at the
same depth is another good option. <strong>(Report from: 7/15/19)</strong>

    Water temperature is in the low 60s. Fishing has slowed a little when casting
white tube jigs, but has gotten much faster jigging them. We recommend using 2"
jigs tipped with Chub meat. Casting red and gold, and yellow and gold Kamloopers
got a lot of bites. You may have to let the Kamlooper sink a little, but most of
the time fish will be on the surface. When trolling for Kokanee, we found that using
silver willow leaf and tomahawk pop gear with wedding rings and squids tipped with
pink maggots would do pretty good. Just remember to try different depths till you
where the fish are. <strong>(Report from: 7/2/19)</strong>
