    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    Fishing is still pretty fast, but only when it is sunny. Fishing bigger spoons
is the way to go. The best spoon to use is a yellow and gold Kamlooper. However,
other spoons like rainbow patterned Daredevils and junior Kamloopers also work,
just not as well as the yellow Kamlooper. Most of the fish are around 10", but
they can be as big as 15" and there is the occasional Wiper mixed in with the
Trout. <strong>(Report from: 10/23/19)</strong>

    Fishing is decent and there is not much algae in the water as long as you stay
away from the dam. While there is a lot of activity on the surface, most of the
fish are not hitting spoons or spinners. Trolling pop gear and a worm will catch
a few fish. However, jigging small green and white tube jigs tipped with pink maggots
or worm will catch a lot of fish very fast as long as you are over a lot of fish.
The best way to find an area with a lot fish in it is to use your electronics to
find them and the depth they are at. <strong>(Report from: 10/18/19)</strong>

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>

    The water temperature  is 52 degrees, and there is quite a bit of algae throughout
the lake. However, this is not hindering the fish because the bit is hot. The lures
to use are big spoons and big jerkbaits or minnowbaits. The best color for spoons
is orange, but other colors like yellow, red, or rainbow pattern also work. Lucky
Craft 115s that are patterned like Chub will get you a lot of bigger fish. The best
way to trigger a bite with the Lucky Crafts is to use a stop and go retrieve. Most
of the fish are around 12-14 inches, but there is plenty of 16-18 inchers and occasionally
there is a slot buster within those smaller fish. <strong>(Report from: 10/5/19)</strong>
