    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Good Ski Lake</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is great thanks to a recent stocking of 2600 Rainbows. Water clarity
is pretty good but not great. The best lures to use are green Jakes or a fire tiger
Daredevil spoon. Kamloopers work and will catch fish, but not to the extent that
the Jakes and the Daredevils do. <strong>(Report from: 10/1/19)</strong>

  <h3>Adams</h3>
  <p>
    Due to a recnet stocking the fishing has picked up. Fishing Kamloopers or junior
Kamloopers is the way to go. The best colors to use are red, gold, and white or
yellow and gold. Orange and gold my also work, but due to the fact that the water
is no super clear it doesn't do as good as the other colors. <strong>(Report from: 9/26/19)</strong>

  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is decent from the shore using spoons and spinners. The best spoons
are Kamloopers and Pot-O-Golds. Red Jakes will also catch a few fish. Fishing on
the bottom with powerbait or worm and a marshmallow will also catch a few fish.
Most of the fish are planter size. <strong>(Report from: 9/25/19)</strong>

  <h3>Glassmans</h3>
  <p>
    The pond was recently stocked with small Rainbow Trout. Most of the trout
are on the surface, and water clarity is pretty good. This makes the spinner fishing
good. The best lures to use are: small Jakes, junior Kamloopers, and small roaster
tail spinners. Most of the trout are 6-9 inches, but there are a few bigger ones
around. <strong>(Report from: 9/25/19)</strong>
