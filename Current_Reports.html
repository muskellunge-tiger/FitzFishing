    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports.

  <h3>Jensen</h3>
  <p>
    When we went to Jensen the lake was mostly covered with very thin ice, so there
was not a lot of fishing spots. But because the ice was so thin, I'm sure it will
all melt in a day or two. The method that worked best was fishing rainobw powerbait
on the bottom with about a 2-foot leader. This caught us 2 fish, and got many more
bites. Another method that worked was casting small 1 inch tube jigs, and slowly
reeling them back. This caught us 1 fish, and got a few more bites. All in all,
fishing was very slow, but I think once the ice goes away and you are able to fish
more of the lake the fishing will pick up. <strong>(Report from: 2/8/19)</strong>
