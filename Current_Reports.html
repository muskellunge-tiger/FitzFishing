    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is fast when it is sunny, but much slower when cloudy. Water temperature
is in the high 60s. Most of the fish are around 35 to 45 feet down. Casting and
jigging 2-3" white tube jigs with 3/8 oz. jig head tipped with Chub meat will catch
a ton of fish. Usually while it is calm casting works better, and while it is windy
jigging works better. You may also be able to catch a few fish on a spinner or spoon
on calm sunny mornings. <strong>(Report from: 7/31/19)</strong>

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is good from a boat in most of the lake. Trolling and jigging tube jigs
will catch you a good amount of fish. While it is clam find an area with a far
number of fish, and jig 1.5 to 2 inch white and translucent blue tube jigs tipped
with Chub meat. When the wind picks up troll silver willow leaf pop gear, sliver
triangle flashers, or sling rig dodgers with a worm at around 25-40 feet depending
on the time of day. <strong>(Report from: 7/25/19)</strong>

  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing has really slowed. Trolling pop gear and a worm around 25-30 feet down
in the early morning is the best way to catch a few fish. By late morning and early
afternoon the bite really slows. <strong>(Report from: 7/24/19)</strong>
