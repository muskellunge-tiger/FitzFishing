    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    While there is a fair amount of fish in the lake that are in close and hitting
the surface, the fishing is still a little slow. Spinners and spoons are quite
doing good yet, and tube jigs are also not performing well either. The only success
that we had was fishing with woolly bugger flies. We also some other people catch
a few fish off the bottom using worms. But mainly for right now it seems as if the
fishing is still slow. <strong>(Report from: 3/26/20)</strong>

    Fishing is very slow right now with spoons and spinners. We tried multiple
different spoons and spinners. Along with multiple different colors, with only
a few that worked. The best spoons are a red white and gold junior Kamlooper and
white Pot-O-Golds. The best spinner is a green Jake, but all in all none of these
lures really perform better than the other. <strong>(Report from: 3/22/20)</strong>

    There is pretty much no more slush on the lake and the ice is about 20" thick.
The fishing however, has slowed massively. While at lot of fish would come through
they would not bite very often at all. We believe this is because most of the
Cutthroats that would come through were very small, and who not be able to eat
bigger jigs, and then they would not be interested in smaller jigs either. The
best way to catch fish would be to drop a small yellow Atomic tube down about 15
feet down and wait for either Rainbows or Kokanee to come through. This is because
the Rainbows and Kokanee are bigger and much more aggressive then the Cutts right
now. However, this problem will likely change very soon.

    The lake just recentally unfroze, so the fishing is a little slow right now.
However, there appears to be quite a few fish in the lake, so the fishing should
pick up in the coming weeks. The best lures that worked for us were fire tiger
Daredevils and silver and green number 2 Bluefoxes. A slower retrieve is better
right now because the water is still a little cold. <strong>(Report from: 3/15/20)</strong>
