    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    The pond is completely ice free, and the fishing is pretty good. The best method
to use is fishing on the bottom with either half a worm and half a marshmallow or
a whole rainbow patterned Trout nugget. However, we recommend that you cut the
Trout nugget in half then put it on the hook, so that it will stay on the hook
better and give it a more compact look. This compact look is good because most of
the fish are smaller. Another method the works is bottom bouncing a 1.5" yellow
tube jig tipped with a piece of fire corn (pink piece of corn).

    There is some bad slush in parts of the lake and a few inches of snow on the
ice, so it's a good idea to wear snowshoes and be very careful when driving snowmobiles
on the lake because of the possibly of getting stuck. As for the fishing, it's
pretty good. The best jigs to use are 2-3" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz. jig head
tipped with Chub meat. We recommend that you add a "stinger hook" to your jig because
pretty much all of the fish are just nipping at the tails of the jigs, so by adding
this you will have a much higher catch rate. When jigging it's a good idea to jig
lightly as this seems to cause the fish to bite better. However, if they don't
and are just looking, then it's a good idea to make a really quick half to one
turn of your reel to see if you can get the fish to follow. This will mostly likely
trigger a strike if they follow. If they don't hit it on the first crank but follow
aggressively, then just repeat the process and sooner or later they will likely
bite. Another good method was to fish a white Marabou with an orange jig head tipped
with half a worm about 10-15 feet below the ice to catch high flying fish. Most
of the fish are around 16". <strong>(Report from: 1/20/20)</strong>
