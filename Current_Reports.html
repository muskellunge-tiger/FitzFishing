    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    The lake is ice free, and the water is fairly clear. Fishing from shore is slowing
down, but you are still able to catch nice Rainbows and Cutts. Try to steep drop
offs near shore, lake the dam on the Soldier Creek side. Fishing white tub jigs
with a 3/8oz. head tipped with chub meat will get a few bites. Large silver or
gold spoons like Kamloopers and Pot-o-Golds will catch good sized Rainbows and Cutts
at pretty good rate. If you see small chub swimming near the shore that are being
attacked by Cutthroats, use large Lucky Craft jerkbait minnows. Bait fishing for
us was not working at all. <strong>(Report from: 5/13/19)</strong>

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Water clarity is surprisingly good, and fishing is good in the mornings. Fishing
red and gold Pot-o-Golds, red and white Kamloopers, and silver Crocodile spoons work
best in the early morning when the fish are up shallow, and on the surface. Most
of the fish are planter sized Rainbows and Cutts. We also did catch a Tiger Trout.
in the late mornings the spoon fishing slows, and the bottom action picks up. This
is also a good time to catch some bigger fish. Try using half a worm and half a
marshmallow 1 to 3 feet off the bottom. <strong>(Report from: 5/4/19)</strong>

  <h3>Hobbs</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing with spinners and spoons is great in the mornings and evenings for Trout.
The best color to use is silver, but other colors like gold and red will also get
bites. The spinner is a silver Jake, and the best spoon is a Crocodile. Most of the
fish range from 13 to 18 inches. <strong>(Report from: 5/3/19)</strong>

  <h3>Adams</h3>
  <p>
    There is a fair number of algae, but the water is clear. There multiple 16-20"
Rainbows swimming along the shore and some smaller fish farther out. Fishing is slow. Fishing
on bottom will most likely give success on the docks, and fishing with spinners will
also work. The best spinners we found to work where Kamloopers and Jakes. We also
got multiple fish to follow small lipless crankbaits. <strong>(Report from: 4/25/19)</strong>
