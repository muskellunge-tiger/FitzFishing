    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    The lake is ice free, and fish are active on the surface. However, we where
unable to catch any fish on spinners, spoons, tube jigs, or flies. The bite was good on
the bottom with half a worm and half a marshmallow. Fishing a bobber with half a
worm about 3 feet below the bobber also worked. Most of the fish are 12 to 13 inches
with a few larger here and there. <strong>(Report from: 4/19/19)</strong>

  <h3>Holmes</h3>
  <p>
    After a recent stocking of another 1,700 fish the fishing is getting really
good. Fishing with spoons is what we found to be the best option. Try using spoons
like Kamloopers or Pot-O-Golds. The best colors are red, white, and gold. The fishing
is best in the morning and early afternoon before it dies off in the middle of the
day. <strong>(Report from: 4/13/19)</strong>

  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    Even though the ponds where recently stocked the fishing is absolutely horrible.
Almost every method under the sun does not work. We saw multiple fisherman catch
nothing, and many said they didn't even get any bits. <strong>(Report from: 4/5/19)</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Adams</h3>
  <p>
    Adams was recently stocked with planter sized Rainbows. The fishing is still
a little slow with spinners, and the pond is at max water capacity. We think that
in the near future the fishing will get better. <strong>(Report from: 4/1/19)</strong>
