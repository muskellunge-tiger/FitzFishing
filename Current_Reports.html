    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Holmes</h3>
  <p>
    Holmes is almost ice free. Most of the pond is open water with plenty of fishing
area. The water clarity is also fantastic. However, since it has been a while since
it has been stocked there seems to be little to no fish in the pond. I would recommend
waiting until it is stocked again before heading back out. <strong>(Report from: 3/20/19)</strong> 
  </p>
  <h3>Adams</h3>
  <p>
    Adams is now open to fishing until winter. However, the fact that the lake has
not been stocked since October of 2018 the fishing is horrible. It seems as if there
is no life in the lake. I saw numerus fishermen catch nothing. I would avoid this
area until it is re-stocked. <strong>(Report from: 3/20/19)</strong>
  </p>
  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing has really slowed over the past few days. The possible reason for this
might be due to the crowds from last weekend catching, and taking a lot of the fish
out of the pond. Fishing a green tube jig with pink maggots still work occasionally,
and there is still a decent amount of 18-22" Rainbow Trout in the pond, but there
is not near as many as there where the week before. I suggest that you wait for
the pond to be re-stocked if you want to get on a good bite. <strong>(Report from: 3/19/19)</strong>

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    The slush on the lake is very bad. Most of the fishing are around 20 feet below
the ice with some running a couple of feet below the ice and some near the bottom.
Smaller tube jigs are the best option. The best colors are white and green. Tipping
your jigs with worms or Chub meat will up your bite rate. <strong>THE ROAD TO THE
MARINA WILL CLOSE FOR THE SEASON ON MONDAY (MARCH 18) DUE TO HIGH SNOW LEVELS.</strong>
