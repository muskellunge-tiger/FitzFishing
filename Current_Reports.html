    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    The slush on the lake is very bad. Most of the fishing are around 20 feet below
the ice with some running a couple of feet below the ice and some near the bottom.
Smaller tube jigs are the best option. The best colors are white and green. Tipping
your jigs with worms or Chub meat will up your bite rate. <strong>THE ROAD TO THE
MARINA WILL CLOSE FOR THE SEASON ON MONDAY (MARCH 18) DUE TO HIGH SNOW LEVELS.

    With the warmer temperatures the fish are active on the surface, and eating
small tube jigs with the best color being bright green. Fly fishing also works well.
Most of the fish are 10-12", but there are plenty of 18-20" trout and some might
be even bigger. Tipping your jigs with small pieces of worms or pink maggots will
up your bite rate. Fishing on the bottom won't really catch you anything. <strong>(Report from: 3/12/19)</strong>
