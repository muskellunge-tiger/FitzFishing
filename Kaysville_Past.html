  <h1>Kaysville Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing has really slowed over the past few days. The possible reason for this
might be due to the crowds from last weekend catching, and taking a lot of the fish
out of the pond. Fishing a green tube jig with pink maggots still work occasionally,
and there is still a decent amount of 18-22" Rainbow Trout in the pond, but there
is not near as many as there where the week before. I suggest that you wait for
the pond to be re-stocked if you want to get on a good bite. <strong>(Report from: 3/19/19)</strong>

    With the warmer temperatures the fish are active on the surface, and eating
small tube jigs with the best color being bright green. Fly fishing also works well.
Most of the fish are 10-12", but there are plenty of 18-20" trout and some might
be even bigger. Tipping your jigs with small pieces of worms or pink maggots will
up your bite rate. Fishing on the bottom won't really catch you anything. <strong>(Report from: 3/12/19)</strong>

    The ponds are free of ice, and fishing is great. Pretty much any method works
whether it be casting jigs, fishing on the bottom, fly fishing, etc. you have a
good chance of getting a fish. We found that fishing a small green tube jig tipped
with Berkley Gulp pink maggots worked well when casting with a slow retrieve. Bottom
fishing half a worm and marshmallow also worked great. Most of the trout are around
10-12", with the occasional 20 incher. <strong>(Report from: 3/4/19)</strong>
