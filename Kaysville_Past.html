  <h1>Kaysville Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Due to a recent stocking of Trout, the fishing is very good. The two best
methods to use are fishing on the bottom with half a worm and half a marshmallow
and fishing with a small yellow Atomic tube tipped with a pink maggot. Another
method that kind of works is fishing with a red gold and white junior Kamlooper,
but because it is still a little early in the year it is not the best option at
this time. When fishing with the tube jig you either want to retrieve it slowly
or cast it out and let it rest on the bottom. However, if you don't get a bite
within a minute or two then slowly retrieve it and cast it back out. If you find an
area with a lot of fish in it then this bottom tube jig fishing with get you a bite
pretty much every cast. <strong>(Report from: 3/5/20)</strong>
