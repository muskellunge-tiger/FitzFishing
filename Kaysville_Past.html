  <h1>Kaysville Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The ponds are full, ice free, and the fishing is fast right now. The best lure
to use is a small yellow Atomic tube jig using a slow retrieve method. This lure
works so well that it doesn't require being tipped with bait most of the time to
catch fish. However, if you aren't getting any bites then tipping you jig with pink
maggots is a good idea. Another method that worked if the tube jig wasn't working
was bottom fishing half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 6" leader.
