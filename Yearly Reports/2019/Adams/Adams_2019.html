    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>What to look for</h3>
    <p>
      When fishing Adams there are a few conditions to look for that will make your
fishing experience amazing. First, if your fishing with spinners or anything that is
going to be near the surface you want to be there on a day that is not very windy. The
reason is because the trout tend to feed on the surface when it is calm. Second,
clear skies will help you in almost any circumstance, but it will help most when
fishing fast which seems to be the best strategy at Adams. Now this does not mean
that if it is cloudy that you won't catch fish. It just means that you may not catch
as many fish. Third, if you are fishing fast, like with spinners or cranks, water
clarity is going to be the biggest factor when it comes to your success. If you
do run into a situation where the water is a little cloudy you can still fish fast
just simply use a brighter bait like green or red, and maybe slow your reel down.
Finally, if you see fish jumping like crazy in a spot that nobody is already at
move to that spot as fast as possible. I have seen a ton of times that if you go
to where the fish are jumping you will catch a ton of them, up to 30 or more, in
a short period of time long as you use the right gear.
  </p>
  <h3>Spring</h3>
  <p>
    In the spring Adams was less than stellar when it came to catching fish. Weâ€™re
not too sure why, but it could have been due to the massive water level change from
the fall to the spring. We also think that a lot of the fish were killed due to
a very warm fall in 2018. Even though the water clarity was great the fish would
still not hit spinners, spoons, or lipless crankbaits very well at all, but there
where a few times they did. The best spinners and spoons we found to work were
Kamloopers and Jakes. We also got multiple fish to follow and sometimes bite silver
lipless crankbaits. Fishing on the bottom seemed to work pretty well for some people.
But all in all, the fishing at Adams in the spring was not that great at all.
  </p>
  <h3>Fall</h3>
  <p>
    After a slow start in September, the fishing at Adams got extremely hot. October
was the best time to catch a ton of fish in a short amount of time. The best days to go
where sunny and relatively calm days when the fish were feeding on the surface.
Spoons where the best lure to use throughout this time. The best spoons to use where
red and white junior Kamloopers, orange and gold Kamloopers, yellow and gold Kamloopers,
fire tiger Daredevils, rainbow pattern Daredevils, and red and gold Pot-O-Golds.
The smaller spoons were better to use in the early part of October, while the bigger
spoons worked throughout the entire month, but they really excelled in late October.
When it came to fishing with bait on the surface or on the bottom you pretty much
would not catch anything in early October, and only a few could be caught on bait
by late October. Fly fishing never seemed to really get going at all even though
the fish were very active on the surface. The reason for this is probably because
they wanted something moving fast that they could chase down. But if you used the
right spoons on the right day you caught catch almost 50 fish in a few hours by
yourself.
