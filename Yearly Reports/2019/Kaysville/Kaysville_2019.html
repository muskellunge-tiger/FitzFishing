    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Fishing at Kaysville Ponds was not half as good in 2019 as it was in 2018,
but unlike 2018 you were able to catch some huge Rainbow Trout. Some of the Trout
were 22" and at least 3 pounds which is quite massive for Kaysville. At the
beginning of March, the bite was excellent. Pretty much every method was working. This
included bottom fishing, tube jigs, and fly fishing. There was most likely more
methods that worked, but these where the three that we used the most.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it came to bottom fishing the best bait to use was half a worm and half
a marshmallow with about a 1' to 1.5' leader. You would want you gear to be on a
standard sized water-bubble. If you don't know what a water-bubble is please read
the paragraph at the bottom of the page. While bottom fishing worked great in early
March it quickly died off when the water temperature rose, and the fish began to
feed more on the surface. When this happened was when the tube jig bite got really
good. The best tube jigs to use where green, and the brighter the green the better.
If your jig had sparkles in it that also helped out a lot due to the fact that the
water at Kaysville is very muddy. You would also want to tip your jig with some
kind of bait. We recommend using pink maggots or a small piece of worm. This will
add sent and better visuals, so the fish are able to locate the jig better in the
muddy water. When retrieving the jig, you will want to reel very slow to give the
fish time to see the jig coming past them. We recommend using a light action rod,
so you can better feel the bites. The other method that worked well once it warmed
up was fly fishing. While used this method very little because it is very new to
us, but we did find that using small bee patterned flies worked pretty well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of those three methods the tube jigs and flies worked the best the longest.
Unfortunately, shortly after the bite got really good it died. This was most likely
due to the amount of trophy sized Rainbows that where in the ponds. Which
attracted a lot of people to the ponds. This meant that by late March into early
April the bite was terrible, and it never really got better as time went on. We
tried a ton of different methods ranging from spoons and spinners to tube jigs to
flies to bobbers and bottom fishing. It just seemed that nothing was working for
anyone. The only method that had the slightest chance of working was bottom fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually in early summer once Channel Catfish are stocked the fishing gets
great again. However, for some reason the Catfish bite was terrible this year.
There are a few reasons why we think this was the case for us. One is that in 2018
all of the newly stocked Channel Catfish died almost as soon as they were introduced.
The other is that we might have missed the best time to catch them which is in
June, but we didn't fish it until the beginning of July. All in all, we where
unable to catch any Channels, and only caught one Bullhead. This was a real shame
for us because we hoped that the Catfish fishing would be good this year because
all of the fish didn't die, but this was ultimately not the case.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
