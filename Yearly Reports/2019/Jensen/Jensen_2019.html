    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Fishing Jensen shortly after the ice melted produced some decent fishing.
The first time we went out there was still quite a bit of ice, so there was limited
fishing spots and room to cast. This made it harder to catch fish. Once the ice
completely melted the fishing got a bit better. While casting small tube jigs and
slowing reeling them back worked the best method to use was bottom fishing. The
two best baits to use where rainbow patterned powerbait and half a marshmallow
with one to two pieces of corn depending on the size (Fishing with corn is now
legal everywhere in Utah as of 2019). You would want your bait to be on around
a one-foot leader but you could longer or shorter if you wanted. You would also
want your gear to be set on a standard sized water-bubble. If you don't know what
a water-bubble is please read the paragraph below.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time of year fishing on the bottom was pretty much the only way
to catch fish. We tried lures and caught a few fish, but most of the time we didn't
catch anything on lures. This seemed to be the same for other people that we saw
fishing with lures.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
