    <h3>What to look for</h3>
    <p>
      When fishing Adams there are a few conditions to look for that will make your
fishing experience amazing. First, if your fishing with spinners or anything that is
going to be near the surface you want to be there on a day that is not very windy. The
reason is because the trout tend to feed on the surface when it is calm. Second,
clear skies will help you in almost any circumstance, but it will help most when
fishing fast which seems to be the best strategy at Adams. Now this does not mean
that if it is cloudy that you won't catch fish. It just means that you may not catch
as many fish. Third, if you are fishing fast, like with spinners or cranks, water
clarity is going to be the biggest factor when it comes to your success. If you
do run into a situation where the water is a little cloudy you can still fish fast
just simply use a brighter bait like green or red, and maybe slow your reel down.
Finally, if you see fish jumping like crazy in a spot that nobody is already at
move to that spot as fast as possible. I have seen a ton of times that if you go
to where the fish are jumping you will catch a ton of them, up to 30 or more, in
a short period of time long as you use the right gear.
