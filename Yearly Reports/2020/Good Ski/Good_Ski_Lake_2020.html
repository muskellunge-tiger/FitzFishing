    <h3>Late Winter/Spring</h3>
    <p>
      When fishing Good Ski in the early part of the year, fishing on the bottom
was the way to go. There were a few methods that you could use in order to these
bottom dwellers. The first, and probably most effective was bottom bouncing either
1.5 to 2" orange or yellow tube jigs or 1" green and white Marabou's. The second
would be pretty much bottom fishing with a jig. And the third would be fishing
on the bottom with bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important thing to remember when bottom bouncing these tube jigs
is that a lighter jig head is better. The reasons for this are that it's going to
take longer for the jig to hit the bottom which gives the fish a little more time
to see the jig and it may also attract suspended fish in the area as well. The
other reason a lighter jig head is good is because you will have a much lower
chance of snagging up and while the bottom at Good Ski is fairly clean, there is
still a chance that you could snag up on something if you are using a heavy jig
head. When it came to the bottom bouncing itself, working slow and being patient would
be very important. After casting out as far as you can, and the jig hits the bottom.
Wait around 10 seconds, the reason for this is because any fish that saw the jig
falling might be checking it out, and quite often while youâ€™re waiting the fish
will just pick it up. If this doesn't happen, reel up the slack and do a slow
vertical jig reel down and wait for the jig to hit the bottom again. Once it has
hit the bottom again wait a few second to see if a fish takes. If this doesn't
happen repeat the process. Also remember that this is a finesse tactic so, if you
are not used to this type of fishing you will miss a lot of fish, this also goes
for people who are experienced with finesse fishing. What you have to remember is
that this is how finesse fishing works. Now, you will likely get hit on most of
your casts if you are in the right area, so you will start to get the hang of it
fairly quick. But, the biggest thing to remember when doing this is, when you see
a bite don't set the hook right away you will miss pretty much every time. Instead
wait a few seconds for the fish to take most of the slack out of the line, and
fully eat the jig before setting the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes when you're bottom bouncing jigs you will begin to notice that you
are getting hit in about the same spot on every cast, and sometimes this isn't just
a coincidence. It can mean that there are a lot of fish stacked in that one area.
So, if you suspect this might be the case what you'll want to do is cast your jig
in to the general area that you have been getting hit at and just let the jig sink
to the bottom, just like you would when bottom bouncing. However, this time you
are just going to want to leave the jig sitting on the bottom in the spot that
you casted. If you do happen to cast into an area that has a school of fish then
it is likely that you will get hit before or right as the jig hits the bottom.
However, if you don't get hit right away this doesn't mean that you are in the
wrong area. It could just mean that the fish are not as aggressive and need to
look at the jig before biting or you could have casted a little off where they
were and you may need to give them time to come to it. The best thing to do if you
don't get right away is to let the jig sit for a minute or two and if you still
haven't gotten hit then bottom bounce your jig back instead of just reeling it
back. This is because you still want to give yourself a chance to catch a fish.
And remember, just like bottom bouncing, don't set the hook right away cause you
will likely miss the fish. If you end up going multiple casts without getting a
hit using this method then it is best for you to just go back to bottom bouncing
because you will cover more water that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      For both of these methods we would always tip our jigs with pink maggots,
but if you wanted to use worms, corn, or whatever it would probably work as well.
The reason for this is because a tube jig or Marabou by itself is usually not enough
to get the fish to hit. So, by adding bait to the jig, it would give it some sent
to draw the fish in better, and usually get them to bite better too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When fishing on the bottom with bait, the best bait for us was half a worm
and half a marshmallow on about a 6" leader, but you could probably go as long as
12" if you wanted. The way we would weight our bait to get it to the bottom was
by using a standard sized water bubble. If you don't know what a water bubble is,
please read the paragraph below.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ever ran into a situation where the tube jigs or bottom fishing
weren't working at all. Then you could try to fish with spinners or a bobber. The
spinner that did work for us was a Li'l green Jake, and when fishing with the
bobber we used half a worm and put it about 2' below the bobber. However, while
these methods would work, it seemed that they wouldn't work near as good as the
tube jigs or bottom fishing. So, most of the time if those two methods didn't work
we would just leave and try another day.
    </p>
    <h3>Fall</h3>
    <p>
      When fishing Good Ski in the fall we learned very quickly that it was going
to be a miracle if caught a fish. Which was a little shocking due to how clear and
cool the water was, and the fact that it had done so well last fall. The one time
we caught fish we were fishing on the bottom with half a worm and half a marshmallow,
but the only thing we caught were small Perch. We also tried spinners, spoons,
 and tube jigs with no luck at all on multiple trips.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
