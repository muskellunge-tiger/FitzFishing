    <h3>Late Winter/Spring</h3>
    <p>
      When fishing Good Ski in the early part of the year, fishing on the bottom
was the way to go. There were a few methods that you could use in order to these
bottom dwellers. The first, and probably most effective was bottom bouncing either
1.5 to 2" orange or yellow tube jigs or 1" green and white Marabou's. The second
would be pretty much bottom fishing with a jig. And the third would be fishing
on the bottom with bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important thing to remember when bottom bouncing these tube jigs
is that a lighter jig head is better. The reasons for this are that it's going to
take longer for the jig to hit the bottom which gives the fish a little more time
to see the jig and it may also attract suspended fish in the area as well. The
other reason a lighter jig head is good is because you will have a much lower
chance of snagging up and while the bottom at Good Ski is fairly clean, there is
still a chance that you could snag up on something if you are using a heavy jig
head. When it came to the bottom bouncing itself, working slow and being patient would
be very important. After casting out as far as you can, and the jig hits the bottom.
Wait around 10 seconds, the reason for this is because any fish that saw the jig
falling might be checking it out, and quite often while youâ€™re waiting the fish
will just pick it up. If this doesn't happen, reel up the slack and do a slow
vertical jig reel down and wait for the jig to hit the bottom again. Once it has
hit the bottom again wait a few second to see if a fish takes. If this doesn't
happen repeat the process. Also remember that this is a finesse tactic so, if you
are not used to this type of fishing you will miss a lot of fish, this also goes
for people who are experienced with finesse fishing. What you have to remember is
that this is how finesse fishing works. Now, you will likely get hit on most of
your casts if you are in the right area, so you will start to get the hang of it
fairly quick. But, the biggest thing to remember when doing this is, when you see
a bite don't set the hook right away you will miss pretty much every time. Instead
wait a few seconds for the fish to take most of the slack out of the line, and
fully eat the jig before setting the hook.
