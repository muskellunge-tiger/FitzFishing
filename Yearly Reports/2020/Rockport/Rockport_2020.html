    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Due to virus restrictions in April, we were unable to fish Rockport in the
early part of the year like we normally do, and we were only able to go once this
year and that one time we went the fishing was pretty slow. We were never able to
find something that worked consistently. The method that somewhat worked the best
for us was trolling pop gear and worm. The best pop gear was 4-6 bladed silver
and gold willow leaf with half a worm 6-18" behind the pop gear. We usually trolled
around 1mph. We also tried spinners and spoons, and only caught a couple fish on
a silver spoon. We also tried tube jigs, and while we got bites, we were unable
to catch any fish on them.
