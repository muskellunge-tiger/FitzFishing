    <p>
      Ibantik Lake is located in the Uinta Mountains, and requires you to walk
about 4 miles one way to get to it. Because of this, it is best to make it be at
least a 2 day backpacking trip. Because this lake is located in the Uintaâ€™s, it is
almost guaranteed that the water is going to be crystal clear which usually makes
fishing with spinners and spoons a very good idea. However, we didn't go until
later in the year, so we didn't get a good spinner or spoons bite. Instead, bottom
bouncing 1.5 to 2" orange or yellow tube jigs tipped with a pink maggot was the
way to go.
