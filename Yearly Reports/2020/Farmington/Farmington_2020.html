    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      This year was the first time we fished Farmington Pond, and one thing that
we noticed right away is that the water is almost always very clear. Because of
this, fall fishing with spinners and spoons would be red hot at times. The one day
that we did extremely well in October we used spinners and spoons for around 3
hours and were able to catch over 40 fish. The best spoons to use were either
red white and gold or orange and silver junior Kamloopers and small copper Daredevls.
Spinners like #2 silver and green Bluefox's and lil silver Jakes would also work,
but not near as good as the spoons. Of the three spoons that worked very well we
would say the best one was the red white and gold junior Kamlooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the spinners and spoons work extremely well, they are not always the
best option. For example, in the spring or in late fall when it's starting to get
colder spinners and spoons don't work as well. This is when bottom fishing works
best. For us, the best bottom bait was half a worm and half a marshmallow. Sometimes
chartreuse powerbait or a whole marshmallow alone would work too. All the baits
that we fished were on a 6 to 12" leader with a standard size water bubble as the
weight. If you don't know what a water bubble is, please read the paragraph below.
While bottom fishing does work, we found that it was a very hit or miss method to
use.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
