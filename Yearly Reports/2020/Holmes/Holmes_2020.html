    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      Fishing at Holmes this year was pretty slow almost all the time. The two
best methods to use were spinner and spoons or bottom fishing. When fishing with
with spinners and spoons, smaller lures tended to work best. For spoons, the best
one was a red white and gold junior Kamlooper, and while other spoons like fire
tiger Daredevls and red Thunderbolts would work, they would usually be just a
little too big for most of the fish. So, you would usually get hits but have
a hard time hooking up. Whereas with the Kamlooper, you wouldn't have that problem
as often because it is much smaller. When it came to spinners, a silver and green
#2 Bluefox was the best option, but sometimes Li'l green and red Jakes would work
as well. One thing we noticed when fishing with spinners and spoons is that you
would want to retrieve the spinners slower and the spoons a little faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      If spinners and spoons weren't working, then bottom fishing was another good
method to use. The two best baits for fishing on the bottom were either half a
worm and half a marshmallow or a small piece of rainbow powerbait on about a 1'
leader with a standard water bubble as the weight. If you don't know what a water
bubble is, please read the paragraph below.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
