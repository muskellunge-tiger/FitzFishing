    <h2>Statistics</h2>
    <h3>Summer</h3>
    <p>
      Summer fishing at Strawberry was exceptionally good. Almost all the time tube
jigs would be the way to go. On somedays spinners and spoons would also work in
the mornings and evenings. And trolling would also be a good way to catch a fair
number of fish as well. Of these three methods, the tube jigs were by far the best
and most consistent.
    </p>
    <h4>Tube Jigs</h4>
    <p>
      When using tube jigs at Strawberry in the summer, there is a few different
strategies that you can use in order to catch a ton of fish very quick. They are:
a cast and jig retrieve, jigging, and drift trolling. All of these methods can be
equally effective as long as they are used at the right time and in the right
conditions. The tube jigs that we almost always use are 3/8oz. 2 to 3.5" white
tube jigs tipped with either Chub or Sucker meat. We always recommend that you
tip your tube jigs to not only give them sent in the water, but also so that the
fish will likely come back and hit again if you miss the hook set the first time.
    </p>
    <h5>Cast and Jig Retrieve</h5>
    <p>
      The first and probably most effective strategy for tube jigs is a cast and
jig retrieve. This strategy is by far one of my most favorite to use at Strawberry in
the summer months. While the strategy that we are about to go over might be hard
to understand in words, I have provided a video at the end of the strategies to
show you what I'm talking about in action. Also know that this may take some time
to get good at if you are not used to casting and jigging tube jigs at the same time,
but with the right amount of practice, you should be able to get the hang of it
pretty quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using this method start by casting your tube jig out as far as you can,
and then just leave your bail open to let the tube jig sink to where you see the
fish coming through on your fish finder. Now this may be hard to judge at the start,
but once you catch a few fish your brain will subconsciously know how long
you need to let your jig sink. Once you are down in the range the fish are at
reel up any slack in your line, and then do a somewhat hard vertical jig, then reel
down and repeat. Do this through the whole cast. At some point while doing this
you will go to jig, and there will be a major weight difference, it is at this point
that you set the hook. If you ever hook and miss, which you will, just lower your
rod without reeling to let the jig sink. While doing this if you ever see your line
slack off, and you know you are not hitting the bottom, reel up the slack and set the
hook because what will happen is, the Cutthroat will grab the jig while it is sinking
which will cause your line to slack. If the fish doesn't hit it when you do this
continue the jigging process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your jig has come back into view, stop jigging and let the jig sink for
a few seconds. The reason for this is because the Cutthroats will usually follow the jig
all the way in and then hit it, but you might not see them when they hit it even though
you can see your jig. This is due to the fact that Cutthroats can sometimes blend
in with the water making it hard to see them. To tell if a Cutthroat has hit, just
watch the jig to see if it makes an unusual movement rather than just straight down,
or see if some of the jig seems to disappear. If this happens don't set the hook
right away, instead give it a second or two, and then set the hook to ensure that
the fish actually has a chance to eat the jig a little. If you see the fish hit the
jig, again don't set the hook right away, just wait a second or two then set. Now,
it is very easy to tell if the fish has eaten your jig enough if you can see them
hit it. If you see that they have the whole back half of the jig this means they
have the hook in their mouth, so set the hook. If they just grab the head then
they don't have the hook, but sometimes if you wait a few seconds they will re-adjust
there bit, and get the hook. But if this never happens it is still a good idea to
set the hook to make the fish think the jig is trying to escape. If you do this
most of the time the fish will circle back around, and hit again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If at any time you hook a fish reel it in a little, but then loose it, don't
give up. Sometimes the fish, even though they were hooked, will still come back and
continue to bite your jig. To prove that this can actually happen I have provided a
video at the end of the strategies showing this happening. I highly recommend that
you take the time to practice this method because it will pay off. It only took
me a day to get it pretty well figured out, and after a few days of doing this I
was hooking fish more often than I would lose them, and now that I have done this
for a second year, most of the time I'm losing very little fish. Also remember that
depending on the time of year it is might change how fast you jig your jig. Generally
the speed shown in the video is good, but sometimes if the water is around 70
degrees a slower jig with be need because the fish are not as active. The same
goes for evening fishing around sunset when it's starting to get darker because
won't be able to see the jig as well.
    </p>

    <h5>Jigging</h5>
    <p>
      When jigging tube jigs, it is very important that you have a fish finder with
you, so you can see where the fish are and where your jig is. The thing to do while
jigging is to drop your jig down to the depth that the fish are coming through the
most often. Depending on the time of year it is will determine how deep the fish
are. A good general depth to look for is around 40 to 50 feet as the fish are
around that depth quite often. When a fish does come through if you have an advanced
fish finder you want to watch the behavior of the fish when it is looking at your
jig. Watch to see what happens when you jig, and if the fish follows it up and back
down repeat your jigs a couple of times then dead stick it for a few seconds, and
usually, the fish will hit right away. If the fish doesn't follow your jig
aggressively or not at all, then just simply dead stick your jig, and wait to see
if the fish will hit your jig, which they usually will. If you do set the hook,
but miss them drop your tip back down without reeling, and if your line slacks off
or the jig doesn't sink and you're not on the bottom. This means the fish has
grabbed your jig, so just reel the slack up and set the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      This method is best to use when it is calm, and the boat is not moving or
moving much. The reason is because it is easier to see your jig on the fish finder,
and it is easier to drop down to the depth the fish are at and stay there. If it
is ever windy, but you still want to jig then use the drift trolling method.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h5>Drift Trolling</h5>
    <p>
      Sometimes when the wind picks up at Strawberry it's still okay to use tube
jigs. However, vertically jigging them is now much harder because the boat is drifting
with the wind. Lucky, there is a method that we started using this year that allowed
us to still catch fish jigging even when it was windy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before trying this method, you will need a fish finder so you can see your
jig and what depth the fish are at. The first thing you need to know is that this
method only works well if you are in an area with a high concentration of fish.
This is not too hard to figure out if you have a fish finder. If you are seeing a
lot of fish coming through as you drift then this is where this method will shine.
If you don't see many or any fish coming through then this method will not be the
best thing to use in that area. However, if you want to use it then you just have
to go find an area with a lot of fish in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you are in an area with a lot of fish, the first thing you want to do
is drop your jig off the side of the boat that is going with the wind. This means
that when you drop your jig it will go under the boat. This is also easiest to do
in the back of the boat, so you can get your rod to the other side easier. Just
make sure you watch out for your out-drive. If you drop your jig fast enough then
you will be able to briefly see it dropping allowing you to put it right on the
fish. Another way to know if you are dropping your jig into the right area without
seeing it on the fish finder is to count the drop in your head. We have found that
when using a 3/8oz jig that it takes about 15 seconds to go down 40 feet. If you
are going to use the counting method, then you can simply just drop your jig off
the other side of the boat so you don't have to deal with the jig going under the
boat and having to move to the other side. More often than not if there are fish
on the fish finder as your jig is dropping, they will start to come up after it,
but the most important thing to remember here is to not stop dropping. You want
to stop dropping when your jig line and the fish line come together. This will
also cause the jig to fall past them which for some reason makes them really
aggressive towards it, so you will likely get a bite as you are switching sides
of the boat. If they don't hit it right away, just give it a jig or two and they
will likely hit it. They may also only nip at it, so it may take quite a few tries
to hook them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you drop down while there is no fish coming through or the fish don't bite
right away. Just let your jig drift for a little bit, and sometimes you will get
a bite. If it's been a minute or two and you haven't gotten a bite then your jig
has likely drifted out of the depth range the fish are at due to the wind. The best
thing to do here is to let out some more line then retrieve the jig using the casting retrieve
talked about in the casting section. Doing this has a great chance of you catching
a fish. Another thing that is possible to do, but that is more advanced is to
intercept fish that are coming through after you have dropped down and drifted the
jig for a while. The way you do this is, let out more line just like you normally
would to get your jig deeper. Except this time wait for the fish to move down the
chart a little bit then begin to jig up. This will most likely get you a bite, but
it requires a little bit of practice figuring out have far down your chart you
need to let the fish go. This distance will change depending on your chart speed
and wind speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final method you can use here is, simply dropping your jig down to the
depth that you see the fish coming through most often, and just letting the jig
drift. While this is not the most effective method it can be good to use if you
are doing something else or getting something else ready. We most commonly use
this method at lunch time. The other time this method could be good to use is when
you are trying to find a larger concentration of fish as it will keep a lure in
the water still giving you that chance to catch a fish.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h5>Casting Retrieve & Jigging at the same time</h5>
    <p>
      Once you have really figured out how to use the casting and jigging retrieve,
then you can begin to use that strategy along with jigging at the same time. What
I mean by this is that you simply drop a tube jig down to a depth that you have
been seeing fish come through at on your fish finder, and then cast a tube jig
with another rod. When you do this your jigging rod is almost never going to get
moved or jigged. You just want to let it dead-stick while you cast the other jig
until the jigging rod gets hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      While using this both of these strategies together has the chance of you
catching a ton more fish, it also means that at times it might get a little difficult
to control, especially when both of your rods get hit at the same time, which will
happen if you are in the right area at some point. So, unless you are able to
control and effectively fish both rods at the same time, I don't recommend that
you use both of these strategies at the same time. The reason for this is because
if you can't keep both rods under control and effectively fish both then you're
going to end up missing a lot of fish and that will ultimately mean that you won't
catch more fish. However, if you are able to keep everything under control, then
your catch number will go up a ton if you're in the right area.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      While all of these tube jig strategies will catch you Cutthroat 95% of the time,
it is still possible to catch Rainbows while doing these. This is most likely to
happen when using the casting strategy, but it can still happen with the other two. If
you are really luck you may be able to hook a very large Kokanee, but this is extremely
unlikely. Of the hundreds of times I have casted tube jigs, and the hundreds of fish
I have caught doing it only a few times I caught have Kokanee. So, just know that
if you use any of these methods you will almost always catch Cutthroats with maybe
the occasional Rainbow or Kokanee mixed in.
    </p>
    <h4>Trolling</h4>
    <p>
      When trolling for Cutthroats we find pop gear to be the best option, but
triangle flashers and dodgers also work well. The best pop gear to use is silver
willow leaf with half a worm anywhere from 6" to 3 feet behind the pop gear. The
biggest part of trolling for Cutthroats at Strawberry is making sure that your gear
is at the correct depth, and knowing what depth your pop gear runs at will really
help you out. For example, if you are trolling at 1 MPH. with no weight and 100
feet of line out then your gear is around 25 feet down, but the fish are only
really this deep in early summer and fall. The rest of the time they are deeper,
around 40+ feet, so you will need to add some weight. Remember that it doesn't
take much weight to get the gear deeper plus, the more weight you have the harder
it's going to be to reel especially if you are using pop gear with a lot of blades.
Now, if you have down riggers then you don't need to worry about adding weight,
just simply put your down rigger to the depth the fish are coming through at.
    </p>
    <h3>Fall</h3>
    <p>
      While fishing at Strawberry in the fall can be very cold, it can be some of
the best fishing all year. Depending on what time of fall it is will usually determine
what the best lure to use is. One of the biggest things to remember is that if
you are doing things right you can fish out an area in about an hour or two, so
it's important to remember that if you are not catching or seeing any fish that
you move to a different area in order to start catching again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the time when fishing Strawberry in the fall, spoons are probably
going to be the best lures to use, and because it's fall and the fish are likely
going to be fatting up for the winter, bigger spoons are likely to work the best.
In September this year the best spoon to use was a jumbo orange and gold Kamlooper.
This spoon was by far better than pretty much any other spoon under the sun. There
would be days that we would catch 70 to 80 fish on just this spoons alone. However,
if you only had one of these, like we did, or if you break yours off then you are
going to want to know what else to use to still be able to catch fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, in September, it seemed that if you didn't have the Jumbo
Kamlooper then you probably were going to have a very hard time catching fish
consistently. But come October, the fishing really heated up and the fish were
a lot more aggressive towards other spoons. While the Kamlooper was still dominate,
other spoons like standard and large silver, gold, silver and green, and red and
gold Pot-O-Gold's, Apex 5 of Diamonds, and red and white spoons began to work
extremely good as well. This meant that it was a lot easier to catch more fish,
and because of this, we were able to catch 121 fish in one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to increase your catches is to dead-stick 3/8oz. white tube jigs
while you are fishing with spoons, but remember to only use both strategies if you
know you will be able to keep things under control. You may also run into times
where the spoon fishing is not working, but the tube jigs are. One of the best
ways to figure this out is to use both strategies at the same time in order to see
if one is working better than the other or not.
    </p>
    <h3>Ice Fishing</h3>
    <p>
      At the beginning of 2020 the snow and slush made it very hard to walk if you
didn't have snow shoes. For the most part the best depth to fish was 40 to 60 feet.
There would usually be a mixture of fish that would come through near the bottom
and fish that would come through around 15 feet. Depending on where the fish were
coming through would usually determine what jigs you would want to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the deeper fish, 2 to 3" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat were the
best jigs to use. Because the fish tended to nip at the tentacles of the jigs we
added a "stinger-hook" to the jigs, so we could catch more fish. This "stinger-hook"
addition really made a difference in the amount of fish we could because most of
the fish we caught we usually on the "stinger-hook". For those who don't know what
a "stinger-hook" is, a "stinger-hook" is a smaller hook that you add to your tube
jigs, so that there is a hook in the tentacles of the jig so when the fish are
nipping at them, you will still hook up. "Stinger-hooks" are usually attacted to
the main jig hook with a piece of wire that goes through the eye hole of the smaller
hook and is twisted around the main hook in order to keep it on. You will want to
make sure that your "stinger-hook" is securly on the main hook or else it will fall
off. We also recommend that you bring gear to replace the "stinger-hook" if it
falls off because sometimes even if it's secure, it could fall off.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to getting these deeper fish to bite, there are a few methods
that you can use. The first, and most simple, is to just dead-stick the jig and
wait for the fish to bite. This method usually works best later in the day. The
second, is to use the 3 jigs then pause method described in the jigging section
above. The third, is to make very small twiches with your rod. This usuall works
best if the fish are not as aggressive, but also won't hit a jig that is just
dead-sticked. The final method is to make a really quick half to one turn of the
reel to immitate the jig trying to get away. This method almost always provocks
a hit. However, the fish will not always hit after the first crank, so if they
quickly follow it up, but don't hit. Then you want to repeat the process and see
if they'll hit after the second try. If they still don't hit after the second,
then you want to make a thrid crank. However, this time because you know the fish
is likely just going to follow it and not hit. You will want to make another crank
right as the fish gets to your jig. The only way this quick reeling method will
work is if you have a fish finder.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more shallow running fish, you will want to use smaller tube jigs like
yellow Atomic tubes or just small green or white tube jigs tipped with either wax
worms, meal worms, or pink maggots. Usually we would just drop these smaller jigs
to about 15 feet and just let them dead-stick until a fish came through. Most of
the time if a fish comes to the shallower jig, they would hit right away, but
sometimes you would have to use the lightly twich your rod in order to provock a
bite.
