    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      For the most part the fishing at Hobbs was pretty slow, but that isn't too
unusual for Hobbs. The best lures to use were spinners and spoons, with spoons
being the better of the two. The best spoons for us were silver or gold and red
Pot-O-Golds and fire tiger Daredevls. Junior Kamloopers would also sometimes work
if the Daredevls or Pot-O-Golds weren't. When it came to spinners, the best were
either silver or green Li'l Jakes or silver and green #2 Bluefox's.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the things that you usually had to do when fishing the spinners and
spoons was to let them sink down a little ways before retrieving. This was most
likely because most of the fish weren't right on the surface even though you would
see some surfacing. The reason we suspected this was the case, was because you would
usually get hit as the lure was sinking or shortly after beginning your retrieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the spinners and spoons weren't working then it was likely that the fish
were probably on the bottom. However, since it's illegal to use bait at Hobbs,
the best way to fish the bottom would be to use a small tube jig or Marabou and
bounce it along the bottom. The only problem with this is the fact that you can't
tip your jig with any bait, so it is extremely hard to attract any fish but it
is still possible.
