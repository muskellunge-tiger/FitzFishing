    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      When fishing Kaysville in the early part of the year. Tube jigs were the
dominate lure, like they always seem to be. The best tube jig for us was a small
yellow Atomic tube. One thing that made it obvious that this jig was the best
choice was the fact that you could fish it without tipping it with anything and
still catch fish which is very rare for a tube jig. However, this was not always
the case, so if we were fishing it without any bait on it and weren't getting any
bites. Then we would tip it with a pink maggot. The retrieve method that worked
best for this jig was a slow retrieve. The best way to do this slow retrieve
effectively would be to use a lighter action rod. This would be good for a few
reasons. The first, is the fact that the fish are smaller, so having a light rod
while fishing with a light jig makes it easier to feel bites. Second, sometimes
if you have a light rod, when the fish would hit you wouldn't even have to set the
hook cause the rod bends so easy that it just sets the hook for you. Whereas a
heavier action rod could sometimes rip the jig out of the fish's mouth. Now, this
doesn't mean that you can't use a heavier rod when using this method, it just tends
to work better with a lighter action rod. If you do plan on using a heavier action
rod we recommend that you don't go any heavier than medium action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing that worked when fishing with the small tube jig was to just
cast it out and let it sink to the bottom and just let it sit there. The only time
this would work would be if there was a lot of fish in a small area. The way we
found this out was by using a larger tube jig and bottom bouncing it, and if we
were getting hit in about the same spot every time then we would know that there
was a lot of fish in that one area. But because we were using a larger jig, we
wouldn't catch many, so we would cast the smaller jig into that area and let sit
on the bottom, and most of the time we would get hit shortly after the jig hit
the bottom. The only problem with this method is that you have to be patient when
a fish first bites because you can't set the hook right away. What you have to do
is wait for the fish to pull out most of the slack in your line, then set the
hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing to keep in mind when letting the jig sit on the bottom is that
this is not bottom fishing with bait where letting your bait sit on the bottom
for 10 to 20 minutes is a good idea. If you cast a tube jig into a good area with
aggressive fish, you most of the time will get hit within a minute at most. So,
if you don't get hit within a minute or two, you're probably not going to get hit.
If this does happen, simply just lift the jig off the bottom, and begin to slowly
retrieve it back and sometimes you will get hit while bringing it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another method that worked would be bottom fishing with bait. The best bait
for us was half a worm and half a marshmallow on about a 6 to 12" leader with a
standard size water bubble as the weight. If you don't know what a water bubble
is, please read the paragraph below. Most of the time when we would bottom fish,
we would also fish the tube jig as well to maximize our catching. If you plan on
doing this there are two things you want to keep in mind. The first is that if
the bite is on, it might get a little crazy cause you may have both of your rods
get hit at the same time. The second is that you wouldn't want to cast your bottom
bait in the same areas you would be casting your jig. For example, you will be able
to cast your bottom bait a lot farther than your tube jig, so unless you know that
all the fish are in close, you don't want to cast your bottom bait close cause
you can work those areas with your jig. The better thing to do is cast your bottom
bait in a completely different area that your tube jig can't get too. By doing
this, you can effectively fish two different areas at once, and this is good cause
then you won't fish out an area as fast and will usually catch more fish. Now, if
you are casting bottom bait in a different area than your tube jig and aren't
getting any hits then it's okay to cast your bottom bait in the same areas as your
tube jig as long as it's not going to interfere with your tube jig.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
