    <h1>Lost Creek Report 2020</h1>
    <h2>Statistics</h2>

    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      For the most part, fishing at Lost Creek this year was very slow. We pretty
much never had a good bite from shore or from a boat when we went up there. For the
most part tube jigs and bottom fishing worked best. When bottom fishing, half a
worm and half a marshmallow on a 6" to 3' leader with a standard size water bubble
as the weight worked best. If you don't know what a water bubble is, please read
the paragraph below. For tube jigs, if you were fishing from shore, in deeper water,
2" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat worked best. When using the white tube
jigs, a casting and jigging retrieve worked best. For a video and explanation on
how to do the casting and jigging method, please refer to the Strawberry report.
If you were using tube jigs from a boat, then smaller tube jigs worked better. The
best ones were 1.5-2" skinny white and green jigs tipped with either Chub meat or
a pink maggot.

    <p>
      Another method that worked from a boat was trolling pop gear and a worm. The
best pop gear was 5 bladed silver willow leaf or tomahawk with half a worm 6" to
2' behind the pop gear. We recommend trolling at 1 to 1.5mph. and letting the pop
gear out 100 to 150 feet, depending on the depth the fish are at. If you are fishing
in the summer you may need to add weight or use down riggers to get the pop gear
down to where the fish are.

    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
