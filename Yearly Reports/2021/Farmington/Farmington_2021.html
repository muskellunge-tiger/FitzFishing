    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The one time that we went to Farmington this year, the fishing was very slow.
There was a lot of fish activity on the surface, but they did not seem to be wanting
to hit any moving baits, and it was hard to use any spinners or spoons well because
there was a lot of grass in the pond and because of the low water level the lures
would get caught in the grass sometimes. While we were able to catch a few fish
on spinners and spoons, we later realized that fishing on the bottom or with flies
was the better option because the fish were not as active as they seemed.
    </p>
