    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Sawbill Lake is the lake that we fished the most during our trip to Minnesota
this summer. This lake offered some great Smallmouth and Walleye fishing in the
mornings and evenings. Every single fish we caught was using the same method and
were off the bottom.
    </p>
    <h4>Best Method</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Worms</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        When fishing with the worms, we would use entire nightcrawlers on a large
        that had no wieght on it, so that the bait would sink slow and not get
        hung up as easy because we were fishing shallow.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Usually what you'd want to do is cast close to shore or near some structure
        or cover that fish could be hiding in to get a bite.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        You would then want to let your bait sink to the bottom and then let it
        sit for a few seconds and if you didn't get a bite then you would slowly
        start to bottom bounce the bait back in order to get a bite.
      </li>
    </ul>
