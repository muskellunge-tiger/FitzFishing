    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Fishing at Jensen in the late winter to early spring this year was red hot.
The fish were very active on the bottom and were hitting very well as well. Because
of this strong bottom activity, bottom fishing with bait and bottom bouncing tube
jigs was the way to go to catch the most fish. Most of the time with bottom fishing
the fish would hit the bait very shortly after it got to the bottom.
    </p>
    <h4>Best Lures and Methods</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Bottom Fishing with Worms</li>
      <li class="list_items">Bottom Bouncing 1" Pink Trout Magnets</li>
      <li class="list_items">Bottom Bouncing 1" Red Tube Jigs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bottom Fishing Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        The bait we always used for bottom fishing was 1/3 to 1/2 of a worm and
        half a marshamllow to float the worm off the bottom on about a 6 to 18"
        leader.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The sinker we used for the bait was a water-bubble and we like to use these
        because you can cast farther and the line can slide through the bubble
        so that the fish will not feel the weight or tension of the gear.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When bottom fishing, keeping your bait in the water for a good period of
        time and having patients is key. Most of the time we say to keep your bait
        in the water for at least 15 to 20 minutes before bringing it in if you
        don't get a bite. However, most of the time the fish would hit the bottom
        gear within a minute of it makiing it to the bottom, so patience wasn't
        always needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bottom Bouncing Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        We always tipped our jigs with pink maggots for extra scent and flavor to
        draw fish in.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When bottom bouncing always keep some slack in your line when the jig hits
        the bottom because the fish will usually need sometime to fully take the
        jig before you can successfully hook them.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Go slow, don't just jig your jig off the bottom right when it hits. Leave
        it on the bottom for a few seconds so that any fish in the area have time
        to investigate.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Be patient, once the fish bites you will see your line start to pull away,
        but this does not mean that you should set the hook right away because the
        fish could drop the jig or not quite have it in it's mouth fully yet. Instead,
        wait until the fish pulls out almost all the slack in your line before
        setting the hook.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Don't get frustrated. This is a finess method that requires good patients
        and timing. This means that you will miss some fish, especially if you are
        new to this kind of fishing method. But if you keep at it, over time you
        will get better and better.
      </li>
