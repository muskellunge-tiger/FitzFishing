    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      When fishing Jensen in mid to late winter this year, there were two methods
that worked very well. They were: bottom fishing and fishing with tube jigs or
Marabou's. When bottom fishing, there was a lot of different baits that would work
well. The best of them for us was either half a worm and half a marshmallow or
rainbow pattered Trout nuggets. The other baits that would work were just a whole
marshmallow or chartreuse green powerbait. One thing we realized when fishing with
the Trout nuggets was that it was better to cut the nugget in half. The reason
this was a good idea was because the fish in Jensen at the time were fairly small,
so by cutting the nugget in half, it made a smaller presentation and made it easier
for the fish to eat the bait. Sometimes the same would go for the half a worm and
marshmallow. If your worms were really big then it would usually be best to cut
the worm into quarters instead of in half to give it a small look. The leader
length that we used was 6", but if wanted to go as long as 12 to 18" then that
would likely work too, and the weight we used was a standard size water bubble.
If you don't know what a water bubble is, please read the paragraph below.

    <p>
      Usually if you are fishing on the bottom with bait in a place that has a
mostly clean bottom, then bottom bouncing jigs can also be a good way to catch
fish, and that was the case at Jensen this year. Because the fish were smaller,
bottom bouncing smaller jigs was best. The two best jigs for us were 1 to 1.5" yellow
tube jigs or green and white Marabou's. We would always tip our jigs with either
pink maggots or fire corn which is corn that is pink. Sometimes, if you were lucky,
spinners and spoons would work. But this was very rare because it was still too
cold at that time for them to work. But the color that worked best for us was
silver.

    <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
    <p>
      A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
  allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
  because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
  feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
  your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
  to get a longer cast over snap weights.
