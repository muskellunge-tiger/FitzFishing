    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      We did not fish Good Ski Lake that much this year, and the few times that
we did the fishing was far from good which. Which was interesting because in previous
years it had been a decently good place to fish. Most of the problems that we ran
into while fishing there in the fall was the fact that there was a lot more grass
near the surface this year as opposed to other years, which made fishing many of
lures that we normally had success on very difficult.
    </p>
    <h4>Best Methods</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Bottom Bouncing a 2" Orange or Yellow Tube Jig</li>
      <li class="list_items">Bottom fishing with Worm and a Marshmallow</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bottom Bouncing Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        We always tipped our jigs with pink maggots for extra scent and flavor to
        draw fish in.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When bottom bouncing always keep some slack in your line when the jig hits
        the bottom because the fish will usually need sometime to fully take the
        jig before you can successfully hook them.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Go slow, don't just jig your jig off the bottom right when it hits. Leave
        it on the bottom for a few seconds so that any fish in the area have time
        to investigate.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Be patient, once the fish bites you will see your line start to pull away,
        but this does not mean that you should set the hook right away because the
        fish could drop the jig or not quite have it in it's mouth fully yet. Instead,
        wait until the fish pulls out almost all the slack in your line before
        setting the hook.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Don't get frustrated. This is a finess method that requires good patients
        and timing. This means that you will miss some fish, especially if you are
        new to this kind of fishing method. But if you keep at it, over time you
        will get better and better.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bottom Fishing Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        The bait we always used for bottom fishing was 1/4 to 1/2 of a worm and
        half a marshamllow to float the worm off the bottom on about a 1.5' leader.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The sinker we used for the bait was a water-bubble and we like to use these
        because you can cast farther and the line can slide through the bubble
        so that the fish will not feel the weight or tension of the gear.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When bottom fishing, keeping your bait in the water for a good period of
        time and having patients is key. Most of the time we say to keep your bait
        in the water for at least 15 to 20 minutes before bringing it in if you
        don't get a bite.
      </li>
    </ul>
