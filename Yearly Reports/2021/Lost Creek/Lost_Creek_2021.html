    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Fishing at Lost Creek this year was fairly good most of the time we went.
The spring fishing wasn't as good as it normally is and the summer had more Chub
then we had ever seen before coming in shallow. However, the late fall fishing was
probably at its best that we had ever seen it. Lots of Trout had moved up shallow
in November and were extremely aggressive. These large amounts of Trout also held
some monter ones as well. Fish that could be 22 to 25" and 4 to 6 pounds at times.
    </p>
    <h3>Spring/Fall</h3>
    <h4>Best Lures and Methods</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Bottom Fishing with Worms</li>
      <li class="list_items">Casting 2.5" White Tube Jigs</li>
      <li class="list_items">Casting 2 to 3" White Beetle Jigs</li>
      <li class="list_items">Yellow and Gold Kamlooper</li>
      <li class="list_items">Red, White, and Gold Kamlooper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bottom Fishing Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        The bait we always used for bottom fishing was 1/2 of a worm and
        half a marshamllow to float the worm off the bottom on about a 1 to 3' leader.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The sinker we used for the bait was a water-bubble and we like to use these
        because you can cast farther and the line can slide through the bubble
        so that the fish will not feel the weight or tension of the gear.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When bottom fishing, keeping your bait in the water for a good period of
        time and having patients is key. Most of the time we say to keep your bait
        in the water for at least 15 to 20 minutes before bringing it in if you
        don't get a bite.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Jig Casting Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        We always tipped our jigs with Chub meat for extra scent and flavor to
        draw fish in.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The most common retrieve that we would use for the jigs would be a porpusing
        retrieve where you would cast out your jig, let it sink, and then begin
        jigging your rod up and then reeling back down and repeating the process
        for the entire cast.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The way you'll know if you get a hit is when you go to jig it will feel
        a little bit more heavy than normal and this is because the Trout will
        normally just grab the jig as it sinks after the jig so you usually don't
        feel the hit.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        If you feel a hit then you need to either quickly set the hook or reel down
        very quickly and then set the hook so the fish doesn't have time to let
        go of the jig before you can hook them.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        If you set the hook and miss, don't give up. Reel up some of the slack and
        let the jig sink for a few seconds, depending on how deep of water you're
        in, and watch to see if you line either doesn't sink or slacks off as it's
        sinking. If either of these happen, reel up the remaining slack and set
        the hook because it means that the fish has hit again.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Once your jig comes back into view, watch closly what's going on because
        sometimes that Trout will follow the jig all the way in. So, if you see
        a fish following your jig and it hasn't spooked off yet but you're running
        out of distance in the water, if the bottom is clear let the jig sink to
        the bottom and let it rest, and somtimes the fish will come and take it
        then.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        If you get to the end of your cast and fish is following and you miss it
        or it turns away on the jig. Don't give up on that fish, watch which direction
        it swims off too and then flip your jig out in that direction and let it
        sink for a few seconds and usually the fish will come back and hit it or
        chase it again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Summer</h3>
    <h4>Best Method</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Bottom Fishing with 2 Hooks and Worms</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        This summer at Lost Creek there was a ton of Chub in the lake that came
        up shallow, and this mean that you could catch a massive amount of Chub
        from shore which was good if you wanted to get some fresh Chub meat to use
        for Trout in the future.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The best way to catch the most Chub was to have 2 hooks on a bottom set
        up that had light weights on it so that you could get out a little ways
        only because the fish weren't that far out. With each hook having a small
        piece of worm on it.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        After casting out, let your gear sink to the bottom and then just wait to
        get hit, and normally if you were in a good area it you would almost always
        get hit right away.
      </li>
    </ul>
