    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Fishing at Holmes this year was better than ever for us. We good consistant
action most of the days that we sere out there. Most of the time this year the
water clarity was good and the fish were very active and hitting spoons very well
many of the times that we went out, especially in the spring. But there was also
times in the late fall that the fishing was pretty good as well with other lures
and baits, so all around fishing at Holmes this year was great.
    </p>
    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <h4>Best Lures</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Red, White, and Gold Junior Kamlooper</li>
      <li class="list_items">Fire Tiger Daredevl</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Spring Spoon Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        When fishing with spoons at Holmes you always want to monitor what's going
        on with the fish and where they are jumping and how far out they are jumping.
        Because that will determine the size of spoon you should use.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When retrieving, you might need to experiment a little because we ran into
        times this year where the fish would sometimes prefer a faster retrieve
        and other times where they would prefer a slower retrieve.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Pay attention to where and when you get hits. There are sometimes where
        the fish will school up in open water and this is an opertunity for you
        to be able to catch fish back-to-back because a lot of times if you caught
        a fish or got a hit in one area, then that probably meant that there was
        other fish around too.
      </li>
    </ul>
