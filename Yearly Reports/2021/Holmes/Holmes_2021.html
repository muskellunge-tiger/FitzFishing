    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Fishing at Holmes this year was better than ever for us. We good consistant
action most of the days that we sere out there. Most of the time this year the
water clarity was good and the fish were very active and hitting spoons very well
many of the times that we went out, especially in the spring. But there was also
times in the late fall that the fishing was pretty good as well with other lures
and baits, so all around fishing at Holmes this year was great.
    </p>
    <h3>Spring</h3>
    <h4>Best Lures</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Red, White, and Gold Junior Kamlooper</li>
      <li class="list_items">Fire Tiger Daredevl</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Spring Spoon Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        When fishing with spoons at Holmes you always want to monitor what's going
        on with the fish and where they are jumping and how far out they are jumping.
        Because that will determine the size of spoon you should use.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When retrieving, you might need to experiment a little because we ran into
        times this year where the fish would sometimes prefer a faster retrieve
        and other times where they would prefer a slower retrieve.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Pay attention to where and when you get hits. There are sometimes where
        the fish will school up in open water and this is an opertunity for you
        to be able to catch fish back-to-back because a lot of times if you caught
        a fish or got a hit in one area, then that probably meant that there was
        other fish around too.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fall</h3>
    <h4>Best Lures and Methods</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Fire Tiger Daredevl</li>
      <li class="list_items">Yellow and Gold Kamlooper</li>
      <li class="list_items">Bottom Fishing with Worms</li>
      <li class="list_items">Bottom Bouncing 1" White Beetle Jigs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Fall Spoon Tip</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        Pretty much all the time this year in the fall at Holmes it was best to
        let your spoon sink alway to the bottom after casting it out in order to
        get hits.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bottom Fishing Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        The bait we always used for bottom fishing was 1/4 to 1/2 of a worm and
        half a marshamllow to float the worm off the bottom on about a 1.5' leader.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The sinker we used for the bait was a water-bubble and we like to use these
        because you can cast farther and the line can slide through the bubble
        so that the fish will not feel the weight or tension of the gear.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        In the late fall at Holmes the fish are usually really close to shore, so
        that means that you do not have to cast your gear out very far at all in
        order to catch the fish.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When bottom fishing, keeping your bait in the water for a good period of
        time and having patients is key. Most of the time we say to keep your bait
        in the water for at least 15 to 20 minutes before bringing it in if you
        don't get a bite.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Bottom Bouncing Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        We always tipped our jigs with pink maggots for extra scent and flavor to
        draw fish in.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When bottom bouncing always keep some slack in your line when the jig hits
        the bottom because the fish will usually need sometime to fully take the
        jig before you can successfully hook them.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Go slow, don't just jig your jig off the bottom right when it hits. Leave
        it on the bottom for a few seconds so that any fish in the area have time
        to investigate.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Be patient, once the fish bites you will see your line start to pull away,
        but this does not mean that you should set the hook right away because the
        fish could drop the jig or not quite have it in it's mouth fully yet. Instead,
        wait until the fish pulls out almost all the slack in your line before
        setting the hook.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Don't get frustrated. This is a finess method that requires good patients
        and timing. This means that you will miss some fish, especially if you are
        new to this kind of fishing method. But if you keep at it, over time you
        will get better and better.
      </li>
    </ul>
