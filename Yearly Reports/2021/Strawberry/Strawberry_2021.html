    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Strawberry in this year was just like it is every year and that excellent
fishing pretty much year round, but especially in the summer and fall. And just
like always there was one lure that destroyed all other and that being the white
tube jig with in our opinion is the best lure that can ever be used up there. This
year was by far our best year so far at Strawberry with many of the days in the
summer and fall surpassing 100 fish caught in a single day.
    </p>
    <h3>Summer</h3>
    <h4>Best Lures</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">Casting, Jigging, and Drift Trolling 2.5 to 3" White Tube Jigs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Jig Casting Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        We always tipped our jigs with Chub meat for extra scent and flavor to
        draw fish in.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The most common retrieve that we would use for the jigs would be a porpusing
        retrieve where you would cast out your jig, let it sink, and then begin
        jigging your rod up and then reeling back down and repeating the process
        for the entire cast.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        The way you'll know if you get a hit is when you go to jig it will feel
        a little bit more heavy than normal and this is because the Trout will
        normally just grab the jig as it sinks after the jig so you usually don't
        feel the hit.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        If you feel a hit then you need to either quickly set the hook or reel down
        very quickly and then set the hook so the fish doesn't have time to let
        go of the jig before you can hook them.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        If you set the hook and miss, don't give up. Reel up some of the slack and
        let the jig sink for a few seconds, depending on how deep of water you're
        in, and watch to see if you line either doesn't sink or slacks off as it's
        sinking. If either of these happen, reel up the remaining slack and set
        the hook because it means that the fish has hit again.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Once your jig comes back into view, watch closly what's going on because
        sometimes that Trout will follow the jig all the way in. So, if you see
        a fish following your jig and it hasn't spooked off yet but you're running
        out of distance to the boat, let your jig sink so that the fish doesn't
        see the boat and then jig try to jig and get the to bite that way.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        If you get to the end of your cast and fish is following and you miss it
        or it turns away on the jig. Don't give up on that fish, watch which direction
        it swims off too and then flip your jig out in that direction and let it
        sink for a few seconds and usually the fish will come back and hit it or
        chase it again.

      <li class="list_items">

    <h4>Drift Trolling Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        Usually wind picks up at Strawberry in the afternoon and this can make it
        hard to use the casting method while the boat is moving because your jig
        will come up faster in the water because of the boats movement. This means
        that drift trolling tube jigs is the best way to go.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        When drift trolling you will want to use your fish finder to see where the
        fish are in the water and where your jig is when you drop it down.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        What you want to do is drop your jig off the side of the boat where the
        wind is to your back, so your jig should go under the boat, this is because
        your jig will drop faster and will show up on your fish finder.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Once your jig shows up on the fish finder and you have it dropped to the
        depth you want move to the other side of the boat so your line is no longer
        going under the boat so you can begin drift trolling. Usually if you drop
        right on a fish they will hit the jig right away.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        Once you are on the other side, for a couple minutes let your jig troll
        and jig it every now and then to try to attract fish. If you get hit and
        miss, don't give up, the fish will likely hit again once your jig sinks
        back down.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        If you go a little bit without getting hit then bring your jig back using
        the same method from the casting section above. This will sometimes trigger
        a bite. If you do not get hit, then simply drop back down repeat the process.

        For tube jigs, use the same tips from above. You just usually will not have
        to let the jig sink as far because the fish are shallower.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        For the Lucky Crafts, a quick stop and go retrieve or trolling at about
        2 to 3MPH. works best.

    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul class="strategies">
      <li class="list_items">
        We always tipped our bigger jigs with Chub meat and our smaller jigs with
        wax worms or pink maggots for extra scent and flavor to draw fish in.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        We will also usually keep our smaller jigs at the top of the water column,
        about 15' or less, so that higher running fish can still be caught. While
        our lager jigs are usually kept deeper.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        A lot of ice fishing is looking at the fish finder and reading what the
        fish are doing and how they are acting around your lure and what you do
        with it. Somtimes some fish will want it moving a lot and other times
        they don't want it moving at all, and there really isn't a way of telling
        which it'll be most of the time, so you will just have to experiment until
        you figure out which they like more.
      </li>
      <li class="list_items">
        If you do have a fish that is aggresive and is wants the jig moving there
        are some things you can do to trigger a bite. The first is to jig your
        jig a few times and then let it hang for a second to trigger a strike. The
        other is to reel up really quick one or two turns and see if the fish follows
        it in order to get a strike. You will know if the fish like these by the
        fact that they will follow the jig. And you might have to try each of these
        methods a few times before getting a bite, so don't give up.
