    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>
      When it came to fishing East Canyon this year, for us, the fishing seemed
to be hit or miss and because of virus restrictions in April, we were unable to
fish East Canyon as much as we normally do. The two times that we went, we fished
from a boat and it seemed that the best method was trolling pop gear and worm. The
pop gear was either 4-6 bladed silver willow leaf, multi-colored (copper,
silver, and gold) Colorado blade, and silver tomahawk blade. We would put half a
worm 6 to 18" behind the pop gear and would troll at around 1mph. If you are
trolling in mid to late summer you may need to add weight to your gear or use down
riggers to get the pop gear down deeper to where the fish are. We would also troll
a 2" yellow flat fish and had some good success on that as well. However, unless
you have down riggers the flatfish will only work in late spring or early summer
when the fish are higher in the water column.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from trolling, there really wasn't anything else that worked for us.
We tried spinners, spoons, crankbaits, and tube jigs and we only caught a few fish
on a small white and green Marabou, so when fishing at East Canyon, we recommend
that you don't hesitate to troll if nothing else is working.
