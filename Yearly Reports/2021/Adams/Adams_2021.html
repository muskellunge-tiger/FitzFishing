    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <h3>What to look for</h3>
    <p>
      When fishing Adams there are a few conditions to look for that will make your
fishing experience amazing. First, if your fishing with spinners or anything that is
going to be near the surface you want to be there on a day that is not very windy. The
reason is because the trout tend to feed on the surface when it is calm. Second,
clear skies will help you in almost any circumstance, but it will help most when
fishing fast which seems to be the best strategy at Adams. Now this does not mean
that if it is cloudy that you won't catch fish. It just means that you may not catch
as many fish. Third, if you are fishing fast, like with spinners or cranks, water
clarity is going to be the biggest factor when it comes to your success. If you
do run into a situation where the water is a little cloudy you can still fish fast
just simply use a brighter bait like green or red, and maybe slow your reel down.
Finally, if you see fish jumping like crazy in a spot that nobody is already at
move to that spot as fast as possible. I have seen a ton of times that if you go
to where the fish are jumping you will catch a ton of them, up to 30 or more, in
a short period of time long as you use the right gear.
  </p>
  <h3>Spring</h3>
  <p>
    Even though Adams was almost completely full in the spring, the fishing for
the most part was very slow. This was most likely due to the poor water clarity
which made it very difficult for spinners and spoons to work effectively. However,
there was still a good amount of surface activity, so there were a couple spinners
and spoons that did work on occasion as long as they were brighter colors so the
fish could see them easier. The best out of them all was a red white and gold
junior Kamlooper. Lil green and red Jakes tended to work pretty good as well.
Small red lipless crankbaits would also work, but they were usually a little too
big for most of the fish. But if you were using one, a stop and go retrieve was
usually the best way to go.
  </p>
  <h3>Fall</h3>
  <p>
    At the start of fall, the water was fairly clear and cool which made the fishing
fairly decent. However, after a storm came in, the water clarity had worsened and
on top of that they were having to run pumps to oxygenate the water to kill off
a toxic algae bloom. So, those two factors combined really caused the water to
become very dirty and also caused it warm up a little as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite all the negative factors, there was still a lot of fish that were
breaking the surface, so spinners and spoons did have a chance at working but they
didn't work as good as they normally do because of the poor water clarity. The
one spoon that outperformed pretty much everything was a fire tiger Daredevl which
in our opinion is one of the best lures to use at Adams, and was the lure that
caught our biggest Wiper (pictured above). Another lure that did pretty good
was a silver and green #2 Bluefox. While the fire tiger Daredevl and the Bluefox
were clearly the best, other spoons like black and white Daredevls, yellow gold
Kamloopers, and red white and gold junior Kamloopers would also work.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the things we quickly noticed, and something that tends to always happen
at Adams in the fall, is that the fish would swim right along the shoreline, so
it was a good idea to make shoreline casts with your lures. One way to almost
always guarantee a bite is when you would see fish surface alone the shore.
However, when casting to these fish you wouldn't want to cast right on top of or
right over them. Instead, you would want to on the outside edge of them away from
the shore. We're not too sure why this works because it only seems to be an Adams
thing. But what we think happens is that even though you see the fish jump close
to the shore, the fish is probably coming from farther out to attack. Which would
make some sense as to why casting on the outside edge of where the fish jumps works.
