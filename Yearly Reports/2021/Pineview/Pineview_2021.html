    <h2>Tiger Muskie</h2>
    <h3>What is a Tiger Muskie</h3>
    <p>
      The Tiger Muskie or Tiger Muskellunge is a hybrid cross between a Northern Pike
  and the True Muskellunge. Like all Muskies they are stealth predators that use underwater
  structure like weeds, rocks, wood, etc. to attack their prey. Because Tiger Muskies
  are hybrids they are unable to reproduce. This is a good thing because we don't have to
  worry about the population getting out of control. Therefore, in Utah it is illegal to keep
  a Tiger Muskie. All Tiger Muskie that are caught are to be immediately released.
  Tiger Muskie can grow to lengths over 50" in Utah making them an amazing sport fish
  to catch. Tiger Muskie, and all Muskie in this regard, are considered to be a fish
  of a thousand casts as they are very hard to catch. Tiger Muskie in Utah are put
  into lakes to kill off populations of pan and trash fish. This along with the fact
  that they can't reproduce is the main reason they are illegal to keep in the three major
  bodies of water they are found in, in Utah.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few places in Utah that are known for having good Tiger Muskie fishing
  these places include: Newton, Scofield, Pineview, and a few others, but Newton and
  Pineview have had Muskie the longest with Scofield getting stocked with them in 2017.
  The number one place in Utah for Muskie fishing is Pineview. This is the place were
  the biggest Muskie in the state was caught coming in at a massive 53.25", and Muskie
  pushing 50" are caught, but are a rare occurrence in Pineview.
    </p>
    <h3>Gear and Strategy Options</h3>
    <p>
      Do to the fact that Tiger Muskies are hybrids they will tend to fight very hard,
  and Muskies do this any way. So, you need to bring heavy tackle with heavy line, and
  a pretty heavy action rod to be able to land one of these beasts. The best line to
  use is braided line as it is the most powerful fishing line. People will use a pretty
  large variety of line weights for these fish ranging from 30 to 85-pound braid, but
  you don't really need to be on the upper end of the limit to have a very good chance.
  If you use 30 to 50-pound braid you will be okay most of the time when it comes to catching
  a Muskie. Along with the braided line you are going to want to have wired leader.
  The reason for this is because Tiger Muskie have big teeth for a freshwater fish
  so without wire leader they can easily break your line with their teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to lures there is a massive variety of sizes, and types of lures
  that work for Muskie. But in Utah, the best size range is 4 to 6 inches, but you
  can go higher or lower if you want. For example, our biggest Tiger Muskie was caught
  at Pineview on a 2" Crappie swimbait, but almost all of our others ones have been
  on 4" bass colored swimbaits. So, when you are fishing for Tiger Muskie consider
  these things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Know what the bait fish are in the body of water that you are
        fishing in. For example, in Pineview the main prey of the Tiger Muskie is Crappie,
        Perch, and sometimes small Bass. Therefore, you are going to want to go to lures
        that look like those fish. Now this does not mean that you have to use lures that
        look like those fish. It's just that your odds may be better if you do.
      </li>
      <li>
        Know the weather conditions. It is very well known that Muskie
        are more likely to hit if a storm front is coming in or moving out. I find this
        to be true as the on time we fished for Muskie before a storm came in, we caught
        a Muskie within 50 minutes where as it usually takes us several hours to catch one.
        But just like with the lures, you do not have to fish for Muskie right before or
        right after a storm to catch one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Always be moving along shorelines of the lake. Tiger Muskie
        are very territorial, and will usually have an area that they patrol when they are
        hungry. So, it is important that you keep moving in order to maximize your chances.
        If you do catch a Tiger Muskie DO NOT stay in that spot. Unlike other species of
        fish Tiger Muskie are at the top of the food chain, and have to eat a lot of fish
        to survive. Therefore, they don't travel in schools they are lone predators, so
        it is extremely unlikely that you will find 2 Muskie in the same spot. While it
        is possible it is pretty rare, and I have only seen it one time when there were
        2 Muskie in the same spot.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you bring your lure back to the boat do not immediately
        pull it out of the water. Tiger Muskie will commonly follow your lure all the way
        to the boat, and use the boat for cover to launch a surprise attack. They may also
        use dirty water and their camouflage abilities to their advantage. This means that
        you must be ready at all times because you never know when a Muskie will launch
        a surprise attack. When your lure comes to the boat the best idea wether you see
        a Muskie or not is to perform a figure 8 motion with your lure. This will sometimes
        cause the a Muskie to attack the lure if one is following. They sometimes will
        follow it around a ton of times, but as long as you see that Muskie you keep doing
        figue 8's. If the Muskie is not biting but still following, try changing speeds
        throughout your figure 8 and possibly change the depth of the lure by sticking
        your rod farther into the water throughout the figure 8.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Following these basic steps could up your chances of catching a Tiger Muskie.
  Please keep in mind that Tiger Muskie are not for beginner fisherman they are very
  strong, and can reach weights over 30 pounds, and they require a massive amount of
  time and effort to catch, so if you don't have very high patients these are not
  the fish for you. Now it is possible if you are a beginner to catch a Tiger Muskie
  if you are with someone who knows what they are doing, and that you understand that
  you can cast for a whole day and catch nothing.
    </p>
    <h3>When Fighting and Landing Tiger Muskie</h3>
    <p>
      When a Tiger Muskie attacks, you will probably not see it coming, and they will
  usually hit your lure with incredible force, so you must be ready for this to happen
  at any time even if you have been fishing for 6 hours with nothing. Once the fight
  begins you won't really be able to do anything but hold on. The reason is because
  the Muskie will likely run at a very high speed all the way to the bottom, and that
  is when the fight begins. You will likely not see the Muskie for a while unless
  you are using very heavy tackle otherwise after a little while the Muskie will come to
  the surface, but this does not mean the fight is over. They will likely take another
  run to the bottom, and fight even more. This could happen a number of times especially
  if the Muskie is in that 50" range.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Muskie is ready to be landed it will come to the surface, and not take
  off again. At this time, you will want to have another person who knows what they are doing
  to net the Muskie. You are going to want a pretty large net for these things do to
  their size. For the person netting they need to be ready for the Muskie to: thrash
  around, try to run to the bottom, or do both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the Muskie is netted, and has thrashed around a bit they are actually pretty
  calm this is probably do to the fact that they are worn out from the fight. Once
  they calm down keep the Muskie in the water to unhook them. The reason for this
  is because the Muskie is at this point very tried and needs to rest, and even though
  they're big they do not last out of water for very long. This means that you need
  have them out of the water for a minute or less, so they don't die. Now it is possible
  to unhook them, take pictures, and kind of admire them if you are very quick, and
  have all your stuff ready before they come in the boat. When unhooking the Muskie,
  you are going to need a large set of plyers because Tiger Muskie have very large
  teeth that will send you to the hospital to get stiches if you are not careful,
  and get bit. <strong id="bite_color">THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT TIGER MUSKIE
  WILL JUST RANDOMLY ATTACK YOU IF YOUR SWIMMING. THEY ONLY BITE PEOPLE WHO CATCH
  THEM, AND ARE NOT CAREFUL WHEN TRYING TO UNHOOK AND HANDLE THEM!</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>Handling</h3>
    <p>
      When it comes time to handle the Muskie always hold it horizontally. Absolutely
  NEVER hold the Muskie vertically that is not a natural position for them to be in
  whereas horizontally is. When holding the Muskie, you can either hold with one hand
  in its gills (just watch for the gill rakers as they are sharp) and support the
  tail with your other hand. The other way is to hold the tail with one hand and use
  your other to support its belly. While each method is great, I prefer method 2 over
  one as you have more maneuverability if they start to thrash. Lucky Muskie don't
  tend to thrash around when you are holding them, but it could happen so just always
  be ready.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      While Tiger Muskie look really cool do to their size and looks, they are not a very
  hardy fish out of water, like Catfish and Carp, like some people might think they are. This means that you
  can't keep them out of the water for a very long time admiring them because they
  will die quick. This is why it is important to have everything you need ready when
  a Muskie is caught, this includes plyers and cameras. I recommend that you record
  the fight, and take a lot of pictures because you can do that in seconds these days.
  Once you do that get them released, and when get home you can admire the video and
  pictures for as long as you want. The reason for this is because you have to remember
  that these fish are put into these lakes to control that populations of small fish
  so the fishing in the lake remains good, so if you are always keeping these fish
  out of the water for a very long time and pretty much killing them, you are ruining
  fishing for others in the future, and remember they can't reproduce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you have some knowledge on how to catch Tiger Muskies better, if your
  a beginner and really want to catch one get out there with people who know what
  is going on and catch yourself an amazing sport fish. If you are already an experienced
  fisherman who hasn't caught a Tiger Muskie yet I hope some of these tips will help
  you succeed in the future, and remember no matter what your fishing skill is always
  be careful cause you don't want the Muskie you caught to put a hospital visit in your
  day.
