    Welcome to the Yearly Reports page. On this page you will be able to look at
our fishing reports and strategies for lakes and ponds that we fished in the year
of your choosing. The reports and strategies on the lakes and ponds will be a summary
on how the fishing was at a specific location. Each lake or pond will also have
the data from the trips we made to that location, so you can see when the best
times to fish that location are. Each lake/pond has also been given a rating for
the year as well as an overall rating from every year combined. Overall rating can
be found on the Overall Statistics page. Ratings are: <strong class="rating_slow">
slow</strong>, <strong class="rating_fair">fair</strong>, <strong class="rating_average">
average</strong>, <strong class="rating_good">good</strong>, and <strong class="rating_hot">
hot</strong>. A locations' rating is based off its catch average compared to the
catch average of all other lakes fished in that year. Calculation break downs are
given for each year at the bottom of that years data. Please know that some places
will not have shorter reports then others depending on the number of trips we
made, and the success we had there. The main purpose of these yearly reports and
strategies is to help you get an idea of what works at a location in one year, so
you can have better success in future years. Please know that the videos may buffer
a few times when played the first time. This is due to the fact that they are high
quality videos. If you play them a second time though, they should not buffer at
all.
