  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <h3>Summer</h3>
  <h4>Kokanee</h4>
  <p>
    Fishing Strawberry in early and mid summer can bring some amazing fishing. One
species that you can catch at a great rate in June is Kokanee Salmon. These fish
are very popular at Strawberry, and are a great eating fish. The best way to catch
Kokanee is to troll for them using green and pink Kokanee lures, like squids, on
dogers. You want to leave a couple foot gap between the doger and the lure. The
reason a doger works so well is because it can make the Kokanee made with the disturbance
it creats in the water. We found that tipping our lures with pink maggots up our
catching. If you want to make home made Kokanee lures I recommend that you use a
circle hook because the Kokanee have very soft mouths, so a bigger hook is a better
option.
  </p>
  <p>
    When trolling for the Kokanee we would let our gear out 100 feet, and sometimes
a little further if the fish where a little deeper. We would troll at about 1-1.5
mph. When comes to rod choice, you are not going to want a very stiff rod because
you want some give cause Kokanee tend to run very fast, and with how soft there
mouths are you can pull the hook very easily if you use a stiff rod. This also
means that having you drag set a little lighter is also a good option, so the Kokanee
can run when they and not pull the hook. We also use level-wind reels with a depth
counter on it, so we know how far out we are. Plus the level-wind reel gives you
better leverage one the fish, and makes it a lot easier to reel your gear back as
a decent amount of drag can be caused. You will find this obvious when using pop-gear
as it creats a lot of drag. Once find an area that you are catching Kokanee if your
fish finder has GPS mark those locations, and continue to troll along that area
because Kokanee sometimes travel in large schools, so usually where there is one
there is many more.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to finding out when the Kokanee are biting best at Strawberry
I recommend that you check the Utah Fishing Report which can find linked in the
footer. This will help you know when the Kokanee are biting the best, and might
even give you an idea of where they are biting best on the lake which is very helpful
because Strawberry is a prett large lake.
  </p>
  <h4>Cutthroat</h4>
  <p>
    If you are having trouble catching Kokanee, or don't have much interest in
fishing for Kokanee you can always fish for Cutthroats. When fishing for Cutthroats
there quite a few different ways to catch them. One of which is to troll for them
by using pop-gear or dogers with worms traling behide it at whatever depth the fish
are at. To help you get an idea over how far pop-gear sinks, if you are trolling
at around one mile-per-hour and your pop-gear is 100 feet out with know weight then
you are probably around 25 feet down. This is a good depth in early summer and fall
, but if it is in mid to late summer then you are going to have to put weight on
your pop-gear or let more line to get to the depth the fish are at. Usually in late
June and early July the Cutthroats are usually in that 40 foot range, so this will
definitally require that you use weights or a downrigger if you have one. Trolling
pop-gear seems to work better for us when the wind picks up at Strawberry which
happens almost every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    While trolling can be a great option for catch Cutthroats, using 2-3" white
tube jigs with 3/8oz heads are probably the single best option for if you want to
catch a massive amount of fish in a very short amount of time. This works especially
well when it is calm which it usually is every morning at Strawberry. There are
a couple of ways to use tube jigs, and catch a large amount of fish at Strawberry
and they are jigging, cast, and trolling. When using any of these strategies I
strongly recommend that you tip your jig with Chub meat. Reason for this is because
the main food sorce for Cutthroats in Strawberry is Chub, so having this will give
fantastic success.
  </p>
  <h5>Trolling</h5>
  <p>
    Trolling tube jigs is the least used method of the three for because if you
want to do this you want to troll at 2-3 mile-per-hour, and this will cause your
jig to be high in the water colum, so if the fish are down deep you won't be able
to catch anything. However, if it is early summer some fish are usually on the
surface, so this can work very well, and it is very simple to do. Just cast the
tube jig out after the boat has started moving, and then if you want want after
you cast let out a little bit more line, and then just wait to get hit. If the fish
are on the surface it will not take long for the jig to get hit. Just make sure
the if you are using the main motor to troll you let the driver know when you are
hook up so they can slow down allowing your line not to have the chance of breaking.
  </p>
  <h5>Jigging</h5>
  <p>
    When jigging tube jigs it is very important that you have a fish finder with
you, so you can see where the fish are and where you jig is. The thing to do while
jigging is to drop your jig down to the depth that the fish are coming through the
most often. When a fish does come through if you have an advanced fish finder you
want to watch the behavior of the fish when it is looking at your jig. Watch to
see what happens when you jig, and if the fish follows it up and back down repeat
your jigs a couple of times then dead stick it for a few seconds, and usually the
fish will hit right away. If the fish doesn't follow you jig aggresivly or not at
all, then just simply dead stick your jig, and wait to see if the fish will hit your
jig, which they usually will. If you do set the hook, but miss them drop your tip
back down without reeling, and if you line slacks off or the jig doesn't sink and
your not on the bottom. This means the fish has grabbed your jig, so just reel the
slack up and set the hook.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing to do while jigging is to slowly lift or reel you jig up when a
fish is looking at it. If you do this, and the fish bits, it will be very light
and you might not even feel the hit at all. What will happen is, the Cutthroat will
grab the jig and swim up with it, so the only thing you will feel is an unusual
amount of weight, and when you feel this that is when you hook them.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the fish are hanging near or on the bottom a good stratgy to sometimes use
is, bottom bouncing. Bottom bouncing is when you drop your jig to the bottom and
then repetively jig off the bottom and back down. When doing this if you jig up,
and ever feel like you are snagged or feel any unusual weight set the hook because
this usually means the fish has just grabbed your jig, but you just didn't feel it.
  </p>
  <h5>Casting</h5>
  <p>
    Casting tube jigs is probably my most favorite thing to do at Strawberry in
the summer months. While the stratgy that we are about to go over might be hard
to understand in words I have provided a video at the end of the strategies to
show you what I'm talking about in action. Also know that this my take some time
to get good at if you are use to casting and jigging tube jigs at the same time,
but with the right amount of practice you should be able to get the hange of it
pretty quick.
  </p>
  <p>
    When using this method start by casting your tube jig out as far as you can
, and then just leave your bail open to let the tube jig sink to where you see the
fish coming through on your fish finder. Now this my be hard to judge at the start
, but once you catch a few fish your brain will sub-conchisisally know how long
you need to left your jig sink. Once you are down in the range the fish are at
reel up any slack in your line, and then do a somewhat hard vertical jig, then reel
down and repeat. Do this through the whole cast. At some point while doing this
you will go to jig, and there will be a major weight differce, it is at this point
that you set the hook. If you ever hook and miss, which you will, just lower your
rod without reelig to let the jig sink. While doing this if you ever see your line
slack off, and you know you are not hitting the bottom, reel it you an set the
hook because what will happen is, the Cutthroat will grab the jig while it is sinking
which will cause your line to slack. If the fish doesn't hit it when you do this
continue the jigging process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once your jig has come back into view, stop jigging and let the jig sink for
a few second. The reason for is because the Cutthroats will usually follow the jig
all the way in and then hit it, but you might not see them when they hit it eventhough
you can see your jig. This is due to the fact that Cutthroats can sometimes blend
in with the water making it hard to see them. To tell if a Cutthroat has hit, just
watch the jig to see if it makes an unusual movement rather then just straght down,
or see if some of the jig seems to disappear. If this happens don't set the hook
right away, instead give it a second or two, and then set the hook to ensure that
fish actually has a chance to eat the jig a little. If you see the fish hit the
jig, again don't set the hook right away, just wait a second or two then set. Now,
it is very easy to tell if the fish has eatten your jig enough if you can see them
hit it. If you see that they have the whole back half of the jig this means they
have the hook in there mouths, so set the hook. If they just grab the head then
they don't have the hook, but sometimes if you wait a few second they will re-ajust
there bit, and get the hook. But if this never happens it is still a good idea to
set the hook to make the fish think the jig is trying to escape. If you do this
most of the time the fish will circle back around, and hit again.
  </p>
  <p>
    If at anytime you hook a fish reel it in a little, but then loose it, don't
give up. Sometimes the fish eventhough they were hooked will still come back and
continueto bit your jig. To prove that this can actually happen I have provided a
video at the end of the strategies showing this happening. For us, this casting
method in one year caught most of the 379 fish we caught out of Strawberry in 2018,
so I highly recommend that you take the time to practice this method because it
will pay off. It only took me a day to get it pretty well figured out, and after
a few days of doing this I was hooking fish more often then I would loose them.
