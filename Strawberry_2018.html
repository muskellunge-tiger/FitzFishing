  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <h3>Summer</h3>
  <h4>Kokanee</h4>
  <p>
    Fishing Strawberry in early and mid summer can bring some amazing fishing. One
species that you can catch at a great rate in June is Kokanee Salmon. These fish
are very popular at Strawberry, and are a great eating fish. The best way to catch
Kokanee is to troll for them using green and pink Kokanee lures, like squids, on
dogers. You want to leave a couple foot gap between the doger and the lure. The
reason a doger works so well is because it can make the Kokanee made with the disturbance
it creats in the water. We found that tipping our lures with pink maggots up our
catching. If you want to make home made Kokanee lures I recommend that you use a
circle hook because the Kokanee have very soft mouths, so a bigger hook is a better
option.
  </p>
  <p>
    When trolling for the Kokanee we would let our gear out 100 feet, and sometimes
a little further if the fish where a little deeper. We would troll at about 1-1.5
mph. When comes to rod choice, you are not going to want a very stiff rod because
you want some give cause Kokanee tend to run very fast, and with how soft there
mouths are you can pull the hook very easily if you use a stiff rod. This also
means that having you drag set a little lighter is also a good option, so the Kokanee
can run when they and not pull the hook. We also use level-wind reels with a depth
counter on it, so we know how far out we are. Plus the level-wind reel gives you
better leverage one the fish, and makes it a lot easier to reel your gear back as
a decent amount of drag can be caused. You will find this obvious when using pop-gear
as it creats a lot of drag. Once find an area that you are catching Kokanee if your
fish finder has GPS mark those locations, and continue to troll along that area
because Kokanee sometimes travel in large schools, so usually where there is one
there is many more.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to finding out when the Kokanee are biting best at Strawberry
I recommend that you check the Utah Fishing Report which can find linked in the
footer. This will help you know when the Kokanee are biting the best, and might
even give you an idea of where they are biting best on the lake which is very helpful
because Strawberry is a prett large lake.
  </p>
  <h4>Cutthroat</h4>
  <p>
    If you are having trouble catching Kokanee, or don't have much interest in
fishing for Kokanee you can always fish for Cutthroats. When fishing for Cutthroats
there quite a few different ways to catch them. One of which is to troll for them
by using pop-gear or dogers with worms traling behide it at whatever depth the fish
are at. To help you get an idea over how far pop-gear sinks, if you are trolling
at around one mile-per-hour and your pop-gear is 100 feet out with know weight then
you are probably around 25 feet down. This is a good depth in early summer and fall
, but if it is in mid to late summer then you are going to have to put weight on
your pop-gear or let more line to get to the depth the fish are at. Usually in late
June and early July the Cutthroats are usually in that 40 foot range, so this will
definitally require that you use weights or a downrigger if you have one. Trolling
pop-gear seems to work better for us when the wind picks up at Strawberry which
happens almost every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    While trolling can be a great option for catch Cutthroats, using 2-3" white
tube jigs with 3/8oz heads are probably the single best option for if you want to
catch a massive amount of fish in a very short amount of time. There are a couple
of ways to use tube jigs, and catch a large amount of fish at Strawberry and they
are jigging, cast, and trolling. When using any of these strategies I strongly
recommend that you tip your jig with Chub meat. Reason for this is because the main
food sorce for Cutthroats in Strawberry is Chub, so having this will give fantastic
success.
  </p>
  <h5>Trolling</h5>
  <p>
    Trolling tube jigs is the least used method of the three for because if you
want to do this you want to troll at 2-3 mile-per-hour, and this will cause your
jig to be high in the water colum, so if the fish are down deep you won't be able
to catch anything. However, if it is early summer some fish are usually on the
surface, so this can work very well, and it is very simple to do. Just cast the
tube jig out after the boat has started moving, and then if you want want after
you cast let out a little bit more line, and then just wait to get hit. If the fish
are on the surface it will not take long for the jig to get hit. Just make sure
the if you are using the main motor to troll you let the driver know when you are
hook up so they can slow down allowing your line not to have the chance of breaking.
  </p>
  <h5>Jigging</h5>
  <p>
    When jigging tube jigs it is very important that you have a fish finder with
you, so you can see where the fish are and where you jig is. The thing to do while
jigging is to drop your jig down to the depth that the fish are coming through the
most often. When a fish does come through if you have an advanced fish finder you
want to watch the behavior of the fish when it is looking at your jig. Watch to
see what happens when you jig, and if the fish follows it up and back down repeat
your jigs a couple of times then dead stick it for a few seconds, and usually the
fish will hit right away. If the fish doesn't follow you jig aggresivly or not at
all, then just simply dead stick your jig, and wait to see if the fish will hit your
jig, which they usually will.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing to do while jigging is to slowly lift or reel you jig up when a
fish is looking at it. If you do this, and the fish bits, it will be very light
and you might not even feel the hit at all. What will happen is, the Cutthroat will
grab the jig and swim up with it, so the only thing you will feel is an unusual
amount of weight, and when you feel this that is when you hook them.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the fish are hanging near or on the bottom a good stratgy to sometimes use
is, bottom bouncing. Bottom bouncing is when you drop your jig to the bottom and
then repetively jig off the bottom and back down. When doing this if you jig up,
and ever feel like you are snagged or feel any unusual weight set the hook because
this usually means the fish has just grabbed your jig, but you just didn't feel it.
  </p>
  <h5>Casting</h5>
