    Welcome to the Yearly Reports page. On this page you will be able to look at
our fishing reports and strategies for lakes and ponds that we fished in the year of your choosing.
The reports and strategies on the lakes and ponds will be a summary on how the fishing was at a
specific location. Each lake or pond will also have the data from every trip we made
to that location, so you can see when the best times to fish that location are.
Each lake/pond has also been given a rating for the year as well as an overall rating
from every year combined. Overall rating can be found on the Overall Statistics page.
Ratings are: slow, fair, average, good, and hot. A locations' rating is based off
its average compared to the average of the year. Calculation break downs are given
for each year once clicked on. Please know that some places will not have as good
of reports then others depending on the number of trips we made, and the success
we had there.
