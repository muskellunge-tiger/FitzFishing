  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    When fishing at Kens lake in Moab in the summer you can expect to see some huge
Bluegill for Utah. Some of the Bluegill that we caught where are 7 to 8 inches, and
the best part about this was that you could sight fish them cause the water was very
clear and the Bluegill were near shore. When it came to catch these Bluegill we
found that the best lure to use was a black fly, but they would eat tube jigs and
sometimes bass wacky worms. It was not only fun catching these Bluegill because of
how big they where, but also because of how many of them there were, so you could
catch a lot of them in a very short amount of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    To go along with the huge Bluegill there were also Largemouth Bass mixed in with
them, and this ment that they were also close to shore, so you where able to sight
fish the bass just like you were with the Bluegill. The best lure that worked for
the bass was a greenish-blue wacky worm. We would flip the worm in to the area that
the bass would be cruising around, and wait to watch them eat the worm which was
really cool to do. Small crankbaits also work, but do to the fact that we didn't
have proper bass tackle with us it made very hard to catch the bigger bass with
the rocks that they would hang around.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the few trout that we caught we found that they where after spinners and
spoons like Jakes and Cast Masters. All you would have to do is cast as far as you
could and reel back at a decent speed, and wait to get hit. I personally think that
if you go to Moab for a vaction or something if you have the time you should go
fish Kens cause the fishing can be amazing, and the fact that you can sight fish
is even better.
