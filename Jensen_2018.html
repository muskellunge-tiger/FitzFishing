  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    The one trip we made to Jensen this year our original goal was to catch Catfish,
but after a short time of fishing with half a worm and half a marshmallow with a
water-bubble on the bottom (if you don't know what a water-bubble please read the
paragraph below) we found that the pond was filled with Bluegill. So, we decided
that we would cast our water-bubbles without water in them and only half a worm
out as far as we could, and slowly reel back and wait for the Bluegill hit. While
this may not seem very fun because the Bluegill where on the surface you would be
able to watch them boil on your bait. Which turned out to be pretty cool.
  </p>
  <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
  <p>
    A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
to get a longer cast over snap weights.
