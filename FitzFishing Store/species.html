    Welcome to the Species Effectiveness page. On this page I will go over different
species of fish, and based on my opinion and experiences rate a tube jigs effectiveness
when fishing for that species. The breakdowns will include: the effectiveness rating,
best and worst times of the year to use tube jigs for them, and a short reasoning
about the data. Again, please note that all of this data is based on my own opinion
and experiences. Also note that what I say here is the most likely case, but as
with a lot of things there may be exceptions.

  <h2>Species</h2>
  <h3 class="species">Trout</h3>
  <img class="species_img" src="Images/DSC01727.JPG" alt="23 inch Tiger Trout">
  <ul>
    <li>Effectiveness Rating = 9/10</li>
    <li>Best Times = Early Spring, Summer, Late Fall, Winter</li>
    <li>Worst Times = Late Spring and Early to Late Fall</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="reasoning">
    In my honest opinion I believe that Trout are the best species to target when
fishing with tube jigs. This is because most Trout species are predatory and hunt
small baitfish which is what a tube jig mimics. The reason that late spring and
early to late fall is the worst time of year is because this is when the water
temperatures are perfect for other lures like spinners and spoons which have a
much faster presentation. Whereas in early spring, late fall, and winter the water
temperature is much cooler, so a slower presentation is much better.

  <h3 class="species">Muskie</h3>
  <img class="species_img" src="Images/DSC04198.JPG" alt="36 inch Tiger Muskie">
  <ul>
    <li>Effectiveness Rating = 1/10</li>
    <li>Best Times = Pretty much never</li>
    <li>Worst Times = Pretty much always</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="reasoning">
    While Muskie is my favorite species of fish to fish for, using tube jigs to
catch them is just not a good option. The reason is because you need to mimic
baitfish very well to get them to strike, and while tube jigs are supposed to mimic
bait fish, they don't do it good enough to convince a Muskie to bite most of the
time.
  </p>
  <h3 class="species">Panfish</h3>
  <img class="species_img" src="" alt="">
  <ul>
    <li>Effectiveness Rating = 8/10</li>
    <li>Best Times = When the fish are in large schools</li>
    <li>Worst Times = When the fish are not in large schools</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="reasoning">
    Of all the species listed on this page, this is probably the species that will
break the best and worst times of the year the most. This is simply because small
panfish like Crappie, Perch, and Bluegill are almost always hunting for small baitfish
which a tube jig mimics well. So, when I say the best time of the year to use tube
jigs for them is <em>when the fish are in large schools</em>, petty much means
that it is the best time to catch a large number of them in a short amount of time.
I know this is true because my dad and I have caught 104 Crappie in a large school
in 90 minutes of fishing.

  <h3 class="species">Catfish</h3>
  <img class="species_img" src="Images/DSC01843.JPG" alt="22.5 inch Channel Catfish">
  <ul>
    <li>Effectiveness Rating = 1/10</li>
    <li>Best Times = Pretty much never</li>
    <li>Worst Times = Pretty much always</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="reasoning">
    In my opinion, fishing exclusively for Catfish with tube jigs is just a terrible
idea. The reason is because Catfish are almost always glued to the bottom looking
for live bait and causations. They are also usually quite lethargic and don't tend
to chase after lures like tube jigs. However, there is always exceptions because
there are people who have caught very large Catfish on jigs, crankbaits, and spinners,
but those people where fishing for other species and just happened to have a Catfish
attack their lure.

  <h3 class="species">Kokanee Salmon</h3>
  <img class="species_img" src="" alt="">
  <ul>
    <li>Effectiveness Rating = 5/10</li>
    <li>Best Times = Summer and somtimes Winter</li>
    <li>Worst Times = Fall and Spring</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="reasoning">
    When using tube jigs for Kokanee or any Salmon you have to remember that this
is only going to work in lakes or the ocean, not in rivers. If you are fishing for
them in rivers then a fly will be your best option. If you are fishing for them
in a lake in the summer then the best thing to do is use a tube jig or squid like
jig while trolling with either pop gear or a dodger. When it comes to actually
jigging for them, it is rare that you will be able to jig for them in the summer,
all though there are exceptions. The best time to jig for them is in the winter
when you are ice fishing. While this is not the most effective method for beginners,
if you are able to figure out where the Salmon are at most of the time then you
can catch a ton of them very fast due to the fact that they are almost always in
large schools.
