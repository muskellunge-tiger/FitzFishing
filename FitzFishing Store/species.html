    Welcome to the Species Effectiveness page. On this page I will go over different
species of fish, and based on my opinion and experiences rate a tube jigs effectiveness
when fishing for that species. The breakdowns will include: the effectiveness rating,
best and worst times of the year to use tube jigs for them, and a short reasoning
about the data. Again, please note that all of this data is based on my own opinion
and experiences. Also note that what I say here is the most likely case, but as
with a lot of things there may be exceptions.
  </p>
  <h2>Species</h2>
  <h3 class="species">Trout</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Effectiveness Rating = 9/10</li>
    <li>Best Times = Early Spring, Summer, Late Fall, Winter</li>
    <li>Worst Times = Late Spring and Early to Late Fall</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In my honest opinion I believe that Trout are the best species to target when
fishing with tube jigs. This is because most Trout species are predatory and hunt
small bait fish which is what a tube jig mimics. The reason that late spring and
early to late fall is because this is when the water tempuratures are a the right
for other lures like spinners and spoons which is a much faster presentation.
Whereas in early spring, late fall, and winter the water tempurature is much cooler,
so a slower presentation is much better.
