    Welcome to the tips and tricks page. On this page you will find some of my
favorite tube jig fishing methods with an explanation on how to use these certain
methods. At the end of all the methods I will rank all methods from most effective
to least effective based on my own opinion. There are many reasons as to why using
tube jigs should be one of your go to options. But probably the biggest reason is because
there is a lot of people who don't use tube jigs when fishing. You will commonly
find this at community fisheries where bait fishing and spinners are the primary
fishing methods. Because of this using tube jigs can be the best option because
the fish in these sometimes heavily fished areas are probably a little more tentative
so, the use of an uncommon lure could be just the right thing to get them to bite.

  <h2 class="methods" id="bottom_bouncing">Bottom Bouncing</h2>
  <h3>Casting</h3>
  <p>
    When bottom bouncing while casting, one thing to keep in mind is that it is
probably one of the most difficult methods. This is not because the method itself
is hard to use. It's because it sometimes requires a delay before the hookset.
This means that you will know that the fish is biting, but you have to wait to set
the hook. This is to allow the fish to eat the jig enough so that the hook gets
in its mouth. So all in all, the biggest thing to keep in mind is that even though
this is a very effective method, especially for Trout, as a beginner you might
miss a lot of fish at first, but once you get the timing down you might just be
able to catch fish on most of your casts.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you plan to bottom bounce while casting, you will be able to do it from
either the shore or a boat. After you cast your jig you are going to want to let
the jig sink to the bottom. After it hits the bottom, I recommend that you let the jig
just sit there for 5 to 10 seconds. The reason for this is because if any fish saw
it sinking down they might just hit it right away. If you don't get a hit after
about 5 to 10 seconds, then you will want to reel up some of the slack then perform
a vertical jig with your rod and reel down (the motion will be similar to the jigging
motion in the Cast and Jig Retrieve section, just slower). After you have completed
the jigging and reeling down motion, you will want to wait for your jig to hit the
bottom again. You will know this has happened when your line appears to slack off.
At this time, you are going to want to wait about a second or two to see if you get
a bite. You will know if you get a bite because the slacked off line will begin
to pull out or tighten up. Just remember to not set the hook right away because
the fish might just bite and drop the jig really quick. You also want to wait for
the fish to pull out as much of the slack as possible so that you will get a better
hook set. If the fish does just bite it and drop it before you set the hook then
just wait another second or two and if the fish doesn't hit again perform another
jig and reel down motion. This will give the imitation that the jig is trying to
get away, so if there is an interested fish then it may cause them bite. There may
also be times where you don't even know that the fish has hit. This is actually
the best type of hit for this method because you are unaware that the fish is biting.
The only downside about this is that you are going to need to have pretty fast
reflexes when you go into your next jig. If this happens, the second you feel the
fish (you will know this because of unusual weight when you jig) you must set the
hook because if you are to slow the fish will drop the jig.
  </p>
  <h4>Advanced Method</h4>
  <p>
    Once you have become more experienced in this method you can begin to almost
predict that a fish has hit as the jig is sinking or right as the jig hits the bottom.
The way you will know this is by carefully looking at you line as the jig sinks.
Because your line will have a slight "bow" to it as the jig sinks, if a fish grabs
the jig as it's falling there will be a very slight flick or tug of the line before it
slacks off like it does when it hits the bottom. If you see this wait for about
a second then reel up some slack and set the hook. If you are really good, then
you can even check to see if the fish still has it by reeling up some of the slack
and then slowly lifting your rod to see if you can feel the fish (this is commonly
referred to as "checking the fish"). If you do feel the fish then you need to quickly
set the hook before the fish drops the jig.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this method may seem pretty cool, if you are a beginner at fishing or
a beginner at this method. It is best to just stick with the simpler methods
explained above. This is mainly because you likely not be able to see the line flick
or tug because your eyes have not trained themselves to see that yet. However, if
you continue to use this method, over time you will begin to see this line flick,
and it will likely up your numbers even more.
  </p>
  <h3>Vertically Jigging</h3>
  <p>
    Bottom bouncing while jigging vertically is much easier then while casting.
This is because you don't have to really wait for fish to pull slack out of the
line before you set the hook. What will commonly happen is after you perform a jig
off and back down to the bottom, the fish will just grab it and on your next jig
you will feel the fish. At this time just set the hook and it should be game on.
You will however, still need to have pretty fast reflexes, so the fish doesnâ€™t
have time to drop the jig.
  </p>

  <h2 class="methods" id="resting_on_bottom">Resting on Bottom</h2>
  <p>
    This method doesn't require you to do as much stuff as other methods, but it
because it is similar to the bottom bouncing while casting method. It may be a
little hard to do at first. What you want to do is cast your tube jig out and let
it sink to the bottom. Then all you have to do is wait for a fish to come by and
pick it up. The only problem with this is that there has to be a lot of fish in
the area in order for it to work effectively. Luckily, there are ways to sometimes
figure out if the fish are congregated in a small area. The first way to do this
is to just blindly cast all over the place until you find what you think is to be
where all the fish are. However, this is probably the worst method if you are
fishing a large area. The second way is to use the bottom bouncing while casting
method. This will sometimes tell you where the fish are based on where in your
cast your getting hit. If you are constantly get hit at a similar distance every
cast then it is likely that there are quite a few fish in that area, so using this
method at that point would be a very effective method. A third method you could
use if you are dealing with smaller fish is to bottom bounce a slightly large jig.
This works because it will be easier for the fish to see, and sometimes the fish
will hit the bigger jig even though they can't really fully eat it. Once you find
an area that you are getting hit a lot with the larger jig then it is best to cast
a smaller jig into that same area, so that the smaller fish can fully eat it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to the hit, it will be similar to the bottom bouncing hit where
the line slowly begins to pull out or tighten. All you have to do is wait for the
fish to pull out almost all the slack before setting the hook. The other thing to
remember is that unlike bottom fishing where you are letting the bait sit on the
bottom for 10 to 20 minutes. With the jig, if you don't get a hit within a minute
or two then reel it in and cast again. If you are using a smaller jig then using
the slow retrieve method (see slow retrieve section below) because the fish may
still bite it as you are reeling it in because they think the jig is getting away.
  </p>

  <h2 class="methods" id="cast_jig">Cast and Jig Retrieve</h2>
  <p>
    The cast and jig retrieve is in my opinion the best method to use when fishing
deep areas of lakes that have larger fish. It is not the most effective option at
community fisheries where the water is usually shallower and the fish are smaller.
Because this method is so complex and slightly hard to explain clearly in words,
there is a video at the end of this methods section to give a visual idea of most
of what is about to be explained. This method also requires you to have some pretty
fast reflexes most of the time, and will also require some patients as you will
sometimes see the fish hit the jig. While this method my seem like a lot to take
in at the start, if you use it and practice it will up your numbers massively when
fishing at lakes.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin this method, start by casting your tube jig out as far as you can,
and then just leave your bail open to let the tube jig sink to where you see the
fish coming through on your fish finder. Now this may be hard to judge at the start,
but once you catch a few fish your brain will subconsciously know how long
you need to let your jig sink. Once you think you are down in the range the fish are at
reel up any slack in your line, and then do a somewhat hard vertical jig, then reel
down and repeat. Do this through the whole cast. At some point you will go to jig,
and there will be a major weight difference, it is at this point that you set the
hook, but remember to react fast because the fish will drop the jig if you are
not fast enough. If you ever hook and miss, which you will, just lower your rod
without reeling to let the jig sink. While doing this if you ever see your line
slack off, you will know this has happened because the tension in your line will
suddenly be lost, and you know you are not hitting the bottom reel up the slack
and set the hook because what will happen is, the fish will most of the time grab
the jig while it is sinking which is what will cause your line to slack off. If
the fish doesn't hit again after a few seconds of sinking continue the jigging process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once your jig has come back into view, this usually only works in clear water
lakes, stop jigging and let the jig sink for a few seconds. The reason for this
is because the fish will usually follow the jig all the way in and then hit it,
but you might not see the fish when they hit it even though you can see your jig.
This is due to the fact that some fish can sometimes blend in with the water making
it hard to see them. To tell if a fish has hit, just watch the jig to see if it
makes an unusual movement rather than just straight down, or if you see some of
the jig disappear. If this happens don't set the hook right away, instead
give it a second or two, and then set the hook to ensure that the fish has actually
had a chance to eat the jig a little. If you do see the fish hit the jig, again
don't set the hook right away, just wait a second or two then set. Now, it is very
easy to tell if the fish has eaten your jig enough if you can see them hit it. If
you see that they have the whole back half of the jig this means they have the hook
in their mouths, so set the hook. If they just grab the head then they don't have
the hook in their mouth, but sometimes if you wait, they will quickly readjust there
bit, and get the hook. But if this never happens it is still a good idea to
rip the jig out of the fish mouth to make the fish think the jig is trying to
escape. If you do this most of the time the fish will circle back around, and hit
again. If at any time you hook a fish reel it in a little but then loose it, don't
give up. Sometimes the fish even though they were hooked will still come back and
continue to bit your jig. To prove that this can actually happen I have provided
a video at the end of this method showing this happening along with the video
showing how to do the vertical jig.

  <caption>JIG CASTING METHOD & CUTTHROAT ATTACK</caption>

  <h2 class="methods" id="slowly_retrieve">Slowly Retrieving</h2>
  <p>
    The slowly retrieving method is probably one of the easiest methods when fishing
tube jigs. This method works best when fishing shallow dirty water that has smaller
fish. This also means that this is probably one of the best methods to use at
community fisheries along with the bottom bouncing while casting method. Because
this method is best when using small tube jigs for small fish, a light action rod
is best. This is because the lighter action of the rod will give a better chance
of hooking the fish whereas a medium to heavy action rod might rip the jig out of
the fishâ€™s mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
    To start this method, you are going to want to cast out as far as you can. Then
you want to begin a slow retrieve back, and wait for a fish to strike. If you are
fishing relatively shallow water then it is best that you don't let the jig sink
too much after you cast. However, if you are fishing slightly deeper water then it
could be a good idea to let the jig sink for a second or two after casting if the
fish are not right on the surface. The reason letting the jig sink for a second
or two is possibly a good idea is because your jig may land near a fish without
you knowing, and if that fish sees the jig sinking then it might come and grab it
right away making your job very easy. When it comes to determining how slow you
should reel, depends on the situation. Sometimes the fish will want the jig moving
very slow whereas other times they might want it moving a little faster, so you
may just have to try a few different speeds until you figure out the correct speed.
While figuring out the correct speed might sound tough, it's really not. After you
catch a couple fish your mind will begin to figure out just how fast you have to
reel.
  </p>
  <h4>Advanced Method</h4>
  <p>
    Once you have fished this method for some time you may be able to begin to predict
if a fish is nipping at or chasing your jig while you are slowly bringing it in. While
most of the bites you will get will be obvious, sometimes there are very subtle
bites that are not immediately obvious. But you are still able to tell that these
bites are happening based on the line action. The first type of subtle bite that
might happen is where the fish is chasing your lure, and very lightly nipping the
jig. The way you will know this is happening is the bowed part of your line that
is out of the water will being to ever so slightly twitch almost as if there is a
little wind moving the line. If you see this happening, get ready because usually
after a few lite taps the fish will either smack it or just grab on to the jig and
begin to swim with it. The other subtle hit that could happen is where the fish
hits the jig from directly behind it causing the bow in the line that is out of
the water to have a little more slack in it. If you see this happen it is best to not
set the hook right away because the fish may just let go really quick. Instead,
take another reel or two and if that bow in the line begins to tense up or you
begin to feel the fish, then set the hook.
