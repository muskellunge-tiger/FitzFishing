    Welcome to the Tips and Tricks page. On this page you will find some of my
favorite tube jig fishing methods with an explanation on how to use these certain
methods. At the end of all the methods I will rank all methods from most effective
to least effective based on my own opinion. There are many reasons as to why using
tube jigs should be one of your go to options. But probably the biggest reason is because
there is a lot of people who don't use tube jigs when fishing. You will commonly
find this at community fisheries where bait fishing and spinners are the primary
fishing methods. Because of this using tube jigs can be the best option because
the fish in these sometimes heavily fished areas are probably a little more tentative
so, the use of an uncommon lure could be just the right thing to get them to bite.
