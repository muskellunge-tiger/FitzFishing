    Welcome to the tips and tricks page. On this page you will find some of my
favorite tube jig fishing methods with an explanation on how to use these certain
methods. At the end of all the methods I will rank all methods from most effective
to least effective based on my own opinion. There are many reasons as to why using
tube jigs should be one of your go to options. But probably the biggest reason is because
there is a lot of people who don't use tube jigs when fishing. You will commonly
find this at community fisheries where bait fishing and spinners are the primary
fishing methods. Because of this using tube jigs can be the best option because
the fish in these sometimes heavily fished areas are probably a little more tentative
so, the use of an uncommon lure could be just the right thing to get them to bite.

  <h2 class="methods" id="bottom_bouncing">Bottom Bouncing</h2>
  <h3>Casting</h3>
  <p>
    When bottom bouncing while casting, one thing to keep in mind is that it is
probably one of the most difficult methods. This is not because the method itself
is hard to use. It's because it sometimes requires a delay before the hookset.
This means that you will know that the fish is biting, but you have to wait to set
the hook. This is to allow the fish to eat the jig enough so that the hook gets
in its mouth. So all in all, the biggest thing to keep in mind is that even though
this is a very effective method, especially for Trout, as a beginner you might
miss a lot of fish at first, but once you get the timing down you might just be
able to catch fish on most of your casts.
  </p>
  <img class="tiger_img" src="Images/IMG_20191103_150918_547.jpg" alt="15 inch Tiger Trout">
  <p>
    If you plan to bottom bounce while casting, you will be able to do it from
either the shore or a boat. After you cast your jig you are going to want to let
the jig sink to the bottom. After it hits the bottom, I recommend that you let the jig
just sit there for 5 to 10 seconds. The reason for this is because if any fish saw
it sinking down they might just hit it right away. If you don't get a hit after
about 5 to 10 seconds, then you will want to reel up some of the slack then perform
a vertical jig with your rod and reel down (the motion will be similar to the jigging
motion in the Cast and Jig Retrieve section, just slower). After you have completed
the jigging and reeling down motion, you will want to wait for your jig to hit the
bottom again. You will know this has happened when your line appears to slack off.
At this time, you are going to want to wait about a second or two to see if you get
a bite. You will know if you get a bite because the slacked off line will begin
to pull out or tighten up. Just remember to not set the hook right away because
the fish might just bite and drop the jig really quick. You also want to wait for
the fish to pull out as much of the slack as possible so that you will get a better
hook set. If the fish does just bite it and drop it before you set the hook then
just wait another second or two and if the fish doesn't hit again perform another
jig and reel down motion. This will give the imitation that the jig is trying to
get away, so if there is an interested fish then it may cause them bite. There may
also be times where you don't even know that the fish has hit. This is actually
the best type of hit for this method because you are unaware that the fish is biting.
The only downside about this is that you are going to need to have pretty fast
reflexes when you go into your next jig. If this happens, the second you feel the
fish (you will know this because of unusual weight when you jig) you must set the
hook because if you are to slow the fish will drop the jig.
  </p>
  <h4>Advanced Method</h4>
  <ul class="special">
    <li class="special_item"><em>
      Once you have become more experienced in this method you can begin to almost
      predict that a fish has hit as the jig is sinking or right as the jig hits the bottom.
      The way you will know this is by carefully looking at you line as the jig sinks.
      Because your line will have a slight "bow" to it as the jig sinks, if a fish grabs
      the jig as it's falling there will be a very slight flick or tug of the line before it
      slacks off like it does when it hits the bottom. If you see this wait for about
      a second then reel up some slack and set the hook. If you are really good, then
      you can even check to see if the fish still has it by reeling up some of the slack
      and then slowly lifting your rod to see if you can feel the fish (this is commonly
      referred to as "checking the fish"). If you do feel the fish then you need to quickly
      set the hook before the fish drops the jig.
    </li></em>
    <br>
    <li class="special_item"><em>
    While this method may seem pretty cool, if you are a beginner at fishing or
a beginner at this method. It is best to just stick with the simpler methods
explained above. This is mainly because you likely not be able to see the line flick
or tug because your eyes have not trained themselves to see that yet. However, if
you continue to use this method, over time you will begin to see this line flick,
and it will likely up your numbers even more.
    </li></em>
  </ul>
  <h3>Vertically Jigging</h3>
  <p>
    Bottom bouncing while jigging vertically is much easier then while casting.
This is because you don't have to really wait for fish to pull slack out of the
line before you set the hook. What will commonly happen is after you perform a jig
off and back down to the bottom, the fish will just grab it and on your next jig
you will feel the fish. At this time just set the hook and it should be game on.
You will however, still need to have pretty fast reflexes, so the fish doesnâ€™t
have time to drop the jig.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2 class="methods" id="resting_on_bottom">Resting on Bottom</h2>
  <p>
    This method doesn't require you to do as much stuff as other methods, but it
because it is similar to the bottom bouncing while casting method. It may be a
little hard to do at first. What you want to do is cast your tube jig out and let
it sink to the bottom. Then all you have to do is wait for a fish to come by and
pick it up. The only problem with this is that there has to be a lot of fish in
the area in order for it to work effectively. Luckily, there are ways to sometimes
figure out if the fish are congregated in a small area. The first way to do this
is to just blindly cast all over the place until you find what you think is to be
where all the fish are. However, this is probably the worst method if you are
fishing a large area. The second way is to use the bottom bouncing while casting
method. This will sometimes tell you where the fish are based on where in your
cast your getting hit. If you are constantly get hit at a similar distance every
cast then it is likely that there are quite a few fish in that area, so using this
method at that point would be a very effective method. A third method you could
use if you are dealing with smaller fish is to bottom bounce a slightly large jig.
This works because it will be easier for the fish to see, and sometimes the fish
will hit the bigger jig even though they can't really fully eat it. Once you find
an area that you are getting hit a lot with the larger jig then it is best to cast
a smaller jig into that same area, so that the smaller fish can fully eat it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to the hit, it will be similar to the bottom bouncing hit where
the line slowly begins to pull out or tighten. All you have to do is wait for the
fish to pull out almost all the slack before setting the hook. The other thing to
remember is that unlike bottom fishing where you are letting the bait sit on the
bottom for 10 to 20 minutes. With the jig, if you don't get a hit within a minute
or two then reel it in and cast again. If you are using a smaller jig then using
the slow retrieve method (see slow retrieve section below) because the fish may
still bite it as you are reeling it in because they think the jig is getting away.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2 class="methods" id="cast_jig">Cast and Jig Retrieve</h2>
  <p>
    The cast and jig retrieve is in my opinion the best method to use when fishing
deep areas of lakes that have larger fish. It is not the most effective option at
community fisheries where the water is usually shallower and the fish are smaller.
Because this method is so complex and slightly hard to explain clearly in words,
there is a video at the end of this methods section to give a visual idea of most
of what is about to be explained. This method also requires you to have some pretty
fast reflexes most of the time, and will also require some patients as you will
sometimes see the fish hit the jig. While this method my seem like a lot to take
in at the start, if you use it and practice it will up your numbers massively when
fishing at lakes.
  </p>
  <p>
    To begin this method, start by casting your tube jig out as far as you can,
and then just leave your bail open to let the tube jig sink to where you see the
fish coming through on your fish finder. Now this may be hard to judge at the start,
but once you catch a few fish your brain will subconsciously know how long
you need to let your jig sink. Once you think you are down in the range the fish are at
reel up any slack in your line, and then do a somewhat hard vertical jig, then reel
down and repeat. Do this through the whole cast. At some point you will go to jig,
and there will be a major weight difference, it is at this point that you set the
hook, but remember to react fast because the fish will drop the jig if you are
not fast enough. If you ever hook and miss, which you will, just lower your rod
without reeling to let the jig sink. While doing this if you ever see your line
slack off, you will know this has happened because the tension in your line will
suddenly be lost, and you know you are not hitting the bottom reel up the slack
and set the hook because what will happen is, the fish will most of the time grab
the jig while it is sinking which is what will cause your line to slack off. If
the fish doesn't hit again after a few seconds of sinking continue the jigging process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once your jig has come back into view, this usually only works in clear water
lakes, stop jigging and let the jig sink for a few seconds. The reason for this
is because the fish will usually follow the jig all the way in and then hit it,
but you might not see the fish when they hit it even though you can see your jig.
This is due to the fact that some fish can sometimes blend in with the water making
it hard to see them. To tell if a fish has hit, just watch the jig to see if it
makes an unusual movement rather than just straight down, or if you see some of
the jig disappear. If this happens don't set the hook right away, instead
give it a second or two, and then set the hook to ensure that the fish has actually
had a chance to eat the jig a little. If you do see the fish hit the jig, again
don't set the hook right away, just wait a second or two then set. Now, it is very
easy to tell if the fish has eaten your jig enough if you can see them hit it. If
you see that they have the whole back half of the jig this means they have the hook
in their mouths, so set the hook. If they just grab the head then they don't have
the hook in their mouth, but sometimes if you wait, they will quickly readjust there
bit, and get the hook. But if this never happens it is still a good idea to
rip the jig out of the fish mouth to make the fish think the jig is trying to
escape. If you do this most of the time the fish will circle back around, and hit
again. If at any time you hook a fish reel it in a little but then loose it, don't
give up. Sometimes the fish even though they were hooked will still come back and
continue to bit your jig. To prove that this can actually happen I have provided
a video at the end of this method showing this happening along with the video
showing how to do the vertical jig.

  <hr>
  <h2 class="methods" id="slowly_retrieve">Slowly Retrieving</h2>
  <p>
    The slowly retrieving method is probably one of the easiest methods when fishing
tube jigs. This method works best when fishing shallow dirty water that has smaller
fish. This also means that this is probably one of the best methods to use at
community fisheries along with the bottom bouncing while casting method. Because
this method is best when using small tube jigs for small fish, a light action rod
is best. This is because the lighter action of the rod will give a better chance
of hooking the fish whereas a medium to heavy action rod might rip the jig out of
the fishâ€™s mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
    To start this method, you are going to want to cast out as far as you can. Then
you want to begin a slow retrieve back, and wait for a fish to strike. If you are
fishing relatively shallow water then it is best that you don't let the jig sink
too much after you cast. However, if you are fishing slightly deeper water then it
could be a good idea to let the jig sink for a second or two after casting if the
fish are not right on the surface. The reason letting the jig sink for a second
or two is possibly a good idea is because your jig may land near a fish without
you knowing, and if that fish sees the jig sinking then it might come and grab it
right away making your job very easy. When it comes to determining how slow you
should reel, depends on the situation. Sometimes the fish will want the jig moving
very slow whereas other times they might want it moving a little faster, so you
may just have to try a few different speeds until you figure out the correct speed.
While figuring out the correct speed might sound tough, it's really not. After you
catch a couple fish your mind will begin to figure out just how fast you have to
reel.
  </p>
  <h4>Advanced Method</h4>
  <ul class="special">
    <li class="special_item"><em>
    Once you have fished this method for some time you may be able to begin to predict
if a fish is nipping at or chasing your jig while you are slowly bringing it in. While
most of the bites you will get will be obvious, sometimes there are very subtle
bites that are not immediately obvious. But you are still able to tell that these
bites are happening based on the line action. The first type of subtle bite that
might happen is where the fish is chasing your lure, and very lightly nipping the
jig. The way you will know this is happening is the bowed part of your line that
is out of the water will being to ever so slightly twitch almost as if there is a
little wind moving the line. If you see this happening, get ready because usually
after a few lite taps the fish will either smack it or just grab on to the jig and
begin to swim with it. The other subtle hit that could happen is where the fish
hits the jig from directly behind it causing the bow in the line that is out of
the water to have a little more slack in it. If you see this happen it is best to not
set the hook right away because the fish may just let go really quick. Instead,
take another reel or two and if that bow in the line begins to tense up or you
begin to feel the fish, then set the hook.
    <li></em>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2 class="methods" id="spinner_spoon">Retrieving Like a Spoon/Spinner</h2>
  <p>
    Of all the methods listed on this page, this is probably the one I use the
least, and probably the least effective. However, this does not mean that it is
a worthless method because there are times where it works. Itâ€™s just that those times
are not often. This method will most likely work best in the fall when the fish
are more active. This is pretty much a method that can replace spinners and spoons
if you don't have any or are just a die-hard jig fisherman. I would also strongly
recommend that you only use this method in clear water due to the fact that it
is harder for the fish to see a jig moving fast unlike a spinner or spoon.
  </p>
  <p>
    To do this method you are pretty much going to follow the same procedures you
would follow when fishing with a spinner or spoon. Simply cast the jig out as far
as you can and reel it back at about the same speed you would when fishing a spinner
or spoon. The only thing that is going to be different between the jig and spinner
is that when you get a hit you are going to want to stop reeling and let the jig
fall for a few seconds, unlike a spinner where you would just keep reeling. The
reason you want to stop reeling and let the jig sink is because first unlike the
spinner the hook is not right on the back of the jig, so if the fish just swipes
at it you will likely not hook them right away, whereas with a spinner you would.
Because of this chance of missing the fish, if you let the jig sink it will
make the fish believe that it has wounded the jig making them think that they now
have a very easy meal to take down. However, if this doesn't happen after a few
seconds then simply just continue reeling.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2 class="methods" id="vertically_jigging">Vertically Jigging</h2>
  <p>
    The vertically jigging method works best at lakes that have slightly larger
fish in it. It also is best to use at lakes because that is where you can launch
a boat unlike most community fisheries. Another think to keep in mind is that if
you are at a lake where the casting and jigging method work then this is a very
good method to have on standby if the fish are not after the casting and jigging
method. Of all methods on this page this is the one that is going to require you
have a fish finder of some sort, but it is strongly recommended that you have a
finder that allows you to see your jig and fish's movement pretty much in real
time. This is because based on how the fish reacts to your jig will determine how
you should work the jig.
  </p>
  <h3>From a Boat</h3>
  <p>
    When vertically jigging from a boat, you will likely be fishing deeper water
for larger fish so it is very likely that you will be using larger tube jigs. At
first you are going to want to drop your jig down to the depth that the fish are
coming through at or where you expect them to come through at. You will be able
to figure this out by looking at you fish finder. When a fish comes and shows
interest in your jig, there is going to be a few things that you are going to want
to look for so you can have the best chance at getting the fish to strike. Now,
the first 2 methods that are talked about you are not going to be able to preemptively
tell which one to use. Simply you are just going to have to use trial and error
and make your best guess based on which has worked the best throughout the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most common thing that will happen is the fish will come up to your jig
and as you jig your jig the fish will begin to follow it up and down. If this
happens while you are making large fast jigs then it is probably the best thing
that could happen. What you want to do is make 3 large jigs, and if the fish follows
it up and down on every single jig, then after the third jig dead stick your jig
(stop jigging). If the fish is fired up enough, then after a few seconds it will
likely hit the jig. However, it the fish hits and you miss, then let the jig
re-sink and dead stick it again. In all likelihood the fish will hit again after another
few seconds. But sometimes if you miss and go to let your jig sink, but it appears
that it is not sinking, you will know this because there will just be slack in your
line, this means that the fish has grabbed the jig before it could fully sink. At
this time reel up the slack and set the hook.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next most common thing is where the fish will come up to your jig, but
not want you to move it very much if at all. If this happens it is best to just
dead stick your jig and wait to see if the fish bites. However, if this doesn't
happen but the fish is still interested, then a good thing to try is slowly lifting
or reeling your jig up. This will usually cause the fish to follow your jig, which
you should be able to see on your fish finder. More often than not after a few
feet of lifting you will begin to feel unusual weight. This means that the fish
has grabbed the jig so set the hook. If you do plan on using this slowly lifting
tactic I would recommend that you slowly reel up instead of just lifting your rod.
The reason for this is because the fish is not always going to hit after a few
feet of lifting. Sometimes it takes 10 to 15 feet of lifting before the fish bites.
Because of this, if you are slowly lifting your rod up you will eventually run
out of room to lift and set the hook, so it is just best to not take the chance
and just slowly reel up.
  </p>
  <h4 class="expert_method">Expert Method</h4>
  <ul class="special">
    <li class="special_item"><em>
      When using the dead stick tactic, there is a way to tell, based on the behavior
      of your jigs reading and the fish's reading, when a fish is going to hit. The
      reason this is an expert method is because I believe it is one of the hardest things
      to see because it is so subtle along with the fact that it is going to require you
      to closely look at the readings on your fish finder. What will happen is when the
      fish's reading and your reading are at about the same depth, sometimes what will
      happen is it will almost seem as if the fish is beginning to move up in the water
      column. This will also cause your jig line to become a little thinner. This is
      because the fish is now coming really close to your jig and is likely about to
      strike. Now, while knowing when a fish is about to hit is an awesome thing, this
      is probably the hardest thing to see. I know this because I have been vertically
      jigging pretty much since I started fishing and have caught hundreds of fish doing
      so, and it was only in the past few years that I began to notice this. So pretty
      much unless you vertically a ton for years and years with a really good fish finder
      you will likely never know that this is happening.
    </li></em>
  </ul>
  <img class="trout_img" src="Images/0429181311a.jpg" alt="21 inch Brown Trout">
  <p>
    The next thing is not actually only a hit. It is another way to vertically
jig. More specifically when it is windy. There are times where it can get to windy
to be able to straight vertical jig or cast and jig. So, the next best thing is
very lightly cast your jig off the side of the boat where your back is to the wind.
Basically, the jig should eventually end up going under the boat and to the other
side. In order to do this is best you are going to want to be right at the front
or back of the boat, so you can easily change sides after the jig has drifted under
the boat. Please remember that if you are at the back of the boat and youâ€™re out
drive is still down, to make sure that your line doesn't get stuck in it. But
before you begin to move to the other side, you are going to want to fully drop
your jig down to where the fish are coming through on your fish finder. If you
cast far enough off the side of the boat and get it to sink fast enough, you will
be able to see your jig dropping for a few seconds. This is will let you know when
are in the right area. However, if you don't see the jig fall then make your best
guess, and then on the next run adjust either your cast or make sure that your
jig sinks as fast as it can. If there are fish on the finder when you are dropping
then the odds of you hooking a fish within a few seconds are very high. The only
thing to remember is that if the fish begins to come after you jig as it is falling
is to let the jig fall just past the fish before you close the bail. This for some
reason really pisses the fish off and almost always causes them to hit right away.
However, before you can set the hook you must get your rod and line around the
front or back of the boat before you can set the hook. Most of the time if you
are still on the side that you dropped off of and the fish hits, you will likely
not even know until you get to the other side where the line will be really slacked
or after a few seconds of drifting you will begin to feel the fish's weight. It
is at this time that you set the hook. If you miss, just simply let the jig re-sink
and continue to drift and usually the fish will come back and hit again.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you drop down and the fish either don't hit right away or there was no fish
on the finder at the time you dropped down. Then just get around to the other side
of the boat and let the jig drift for a few minutes. Most of the time if there
are fish in the area you will get hit within those few minutes. This is because
of the fact that the boat is drifting, so the jig is continuing to cover water
even after you dropped it down. If you don't get hit after a few minutes, let out
some more line to get your jig back down a ways because as you were letting it drift
the jig was slowly coming up in the water column. So, by letting out more line you
are getting the jig back in the zone that the fish are most likely in. After you
have let out more line, wait a few seconds for the drift to pull out the slack in
the line, sometimes at this point you will get hit because the fish saw the jig
sinking, but if this doesn't happen then begin to bring the jig back using the
cast and jig retrieve. This will usually cause fish to chase the jig up ultimately
getting you a possible bite and fish caught.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing to keep in mind is that this method really only works well if there
is a lot of fish in the area the you are drifting through. So, before using this
method I would watch your fish finder to see if there is fish coming through at
a fairly consistent rate. If you see this happening then begin to use this method
and fish all of the sudden are not coming through and you aren't getting bites.
Then the best thing to do is move back to the area that you began to see the fish
come through at. This is also why it is good to have a fish finder that has built-in
GPS, so you can see your drift line and easily get back to where the fish were.
  </p>
  <h4>Advanced Method</h4>
  <ul class="special">
    <li class="special_item"><em>
    Once you have done this method for a while, you can begin to intercept fish
that come through on your fish finder after you have let the jig drift for a while.
To do this you must know what depth you initially dropped to and know about how
much line to let out so your jig and the fish cross paths. While there is not an exact
way of knowing exactly how much line you let out blindly, there is a pretty
accurate way to tell when you have let out about 10 feet of line. To do this point
your rod tip to about 3 or 4 o'clock and lift the tip to about 10 or 11 o'clock.
This will let out about 10 feet of line. After you have done this, wait for the
slack to be pulled out, and begin to bring the jig back using the cast and jigging
method. If you timed it right at some point your jig and the fish should cross
paths and you will likely at that point begin to get hit.
    </li></em>
    <br>
    <li class="special_item"><em>
    Now, you can't just see the fish start to come through and immediately begin
to bring the jig back. You have to wait for the fish readings to move along the
screen a little before you being to bring the jig back. Remember to let out your
line before the fish get to the part of the graph where you begin to bring the
jig back. Now, there is really know way to tell the exact time to start to bring
the jig back because everyone has a different chart speed, wind speed, and drift
speed. So, you will just have to use trial and error until you figure out the right
time to bring the jig back.

  <h3>Through the Ice</h3>
  <img class="trout_img" src="Images/DSC03913.JPG" alt="23 inch Cutthroat Trout">
  <p>
    When vertically jigging through the ice there are some new methods that you
will likely have to use, but the 3 jigs and dead stick along with the just straight
dead stick methods from the boat section will also apply to ice fishing as well.
The first new method is what I like to call quick reeling. What you want to do is
when a fish comes in on your lure and you jig it and they follow it you can use
the 3 jigs and dead stick method or you can make a really quick half or full turn
of your reel. This will sometimes cause the fish to chase after your jig which is
almost guaranteed to cause a bite. However, it's not always as easy as just one
quick reel. Sometimes you need to really fire the fish up in order to get them
to strike. To do this, watch you jig and the fish on your fish finder and when the
fish is about to catch up to your lure give it another quick reel. At this time
you might see the fish's reading speed up as it moves up through the water. If
this happens get ready because the fish will likely hit right away.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a fish comes in and you try either the 3 jigs and dead stick method or the
quick reeling method and the fish is just not hitting, and you have tried dead sticking
but the fish still won't hit. Then it is best to try very light jigging. Basically,
all you have to do is very lightly shake your rod, and sometimes at some point
when you are shaking the rod, you will feel unusual weight this means that the fish
has grabbed the jig, so set the hook. The only problem with this is that you are
going to have to be very quick with your hook set when you feel the fish because
they will drop the jig very quickly once they feel that tension.

  <h2 class="methods" id="bait">What to Bait Your Jigs with</h2>
  <p>
    When it comes to what to bait your jigs with, there is a bunch of different
options. Most of the time it depends on what fish you are going after along with
the size of fish as well. Most of the time if you are going after Rainbow Trout
or panfish like Crappie, Perch, and Bluegill then the best bait for your jig is
going to be either worms like nightcrawlers, mealworms, and waxworms or pink
maggots. If you are fishing for a more predatory fish like Cutthroat, then a
piece of Chub or Sucker meat is going to be the best option. Now this does not
mean that if you use Chub or Sucker meat when fishing for Rainbows or panfish that
you are not going to catch anything, and the same goes for using the Rainbow bait
for Cutthroats, it just means that those baits are the best options for those
specific species.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing that is almost always true though is that when fishing with jigs
you are going to have to use some sort of bait to get the fish to bite. This is
because jigs on their own don't get the fish extremely interested, it's when you
bait it with something that does. This is because whatever you bait the jig with
it is going to cause sent to be put out in the water which the fish are going to
pick up on, and will likely cause them to bite a lot more and a lot faster.
