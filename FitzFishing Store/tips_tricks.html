    Welcome to the Tips and Tricks page. On this page you will find some of my
favorite tube jig fishing methods with an explanation on how to use these certain
methods. At the end of all the methods I will rank all methods from most effective
to least effective based on my own opinion. There are many reasons as to why using
tube jigs should be one of your go to options. But probably the biggest reason is because
there is a lot of people who don't use tube jigs when fishing. You will commonly
find this at community fisheries where bait fishing and spinners are the primary
fishing methods. Because of this using tube jigs can be the best option because
the fish in these sometimes heavily fished areas are probably a little more tentative
so, the use of an uncommon lure could be just the right thing to get them to bite.

  <h2 class="bottom_bouncing">Bottom Bouncing</h2>
  <h3>Casting</h3>
  <p>
    When bottom bouncing while casting, one thing to keep in mind is that it is
probably one of the most difficult methods. This is not because the method itself
is hard to use. It's because it sometimes requires a delay before the hookset.
This means that you will know that the fish is biting, but you have to wait to set
the hook. This is to allow the fish to eat the jig enough so that the hook gets
in its mouth. So all in all, the biggest thing to keep in mind is that even though
this is a very effective method, especially for Trout, as a beginner you might
miss a lot of fish at first, but once you get the timing down you might just be
able to catch fish on most of your casts.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you plan to bottom bounce while casting, you will be able to do it from
either the shore or a boat. After you cast your jig you are going to want to let
the jig sink to the bottom. After it hits the bottom, I recommend that you let the jig
just sit there for 5 to 10 seconds. The reason for this is because if any fish saw
it sinking down they might just hit it right away. If you don't get a hit after
about 5 to 10 seconds, then you will want to reel up some of you slack then perform
a vertical jig with your rod and reel down (the motion will be similar to the jigging
motion in the Cast and Jig Retrieve section, just slower). After you have completed
the jigging and reeling down motion, you will want to wait for you jig to hit the
bottom again. You will know this has happened when you line appears to slack off.
At this time, you are going to want to wait about a second or two to see if you get
a bite. You will know if you get a bite because the slacked off line will begin
to pull out. Just remember to not set the hook right away because the fish might
just bite and drop the jig really quick. You also want to wait for the fish to pull
out as much of the slack as possible so that you will get a better hook set. If
the fish does just bite it and drop it before you set the hook then just wait another
second or two and if the fish doesn't hit again perform another jig and reel down
motion. This will give the imitation that the jig is trying to get away, so if there
is a fish interested then it may cause them bite. There may also be times where
you don't even know that the fish has hit. This is actually the best type of hit
for this method because you are unaware that the fish is biting. The only downside
about this is that you are going to need to have pretty fast reflexes when you go
into your next jig. If this happens, the second you feel the fish (you will know
this because of unusual weight when you jig) you must set the hook because if you
are to slow the fish will drop the jig.
  </p>
  <h4>Advanced Method</h4>
  <p>
    Once you have become more experienced in this method you can begin to almost
predict that a fish a hit as the jig is sinking or right as the jig hits the bottom.
The way you will know this is by carefully looking at you line as the jig sinks.
Because you line will have a slight "bow" to it as the jig sinks, if a fish grabs
the jig as it's falling there will be a very slight flick of the line before it
slacks off like it does when it hits the bottom. If you see this wait for about
a second then reel you some slack and set the hook. If you are really good, then
you can even check to see if the fish still has it by reeling up some of the slack
and then slowly lifting your rod to see if you can feel the fish (this is commonly
referred to as "checking the fish"). If you do feel the fish then you need to quickly
set the hook before the fish drops the jig.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this method may seem pretty cool, if you are a beginner at fishing or
a beginner at this method. It is best to just stick with the simpler methods
explained above. This mainly because you likely not be able to see the line flick
because your eyes have not trained themselves to see that yet. However, if you
continue to use this method, over time you will begin to see this line flick, and
it will likely up your numbers even more.
  </p>
  <h3>Vertically Jigging</h3>
  <p>
     Bottom bouncing jig vertically is much easier then while casting. This is
because you don't have to really wait for fish to pull slack out of the line before
you set the hook. What will commonly happen is after you perform a jig off and
back down to the bottom, the fish will just grab it and on your next jig you will
feel the fish. At this time jst set the hook and it should be game on. You will
however, still need to have pretty fast reflexes, so the fish does have time to
drop the jig.
