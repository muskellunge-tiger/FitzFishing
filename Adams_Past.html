  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>

    Fishing is still pretty fast, but only when it is sunny. Fishing bigger spoons
is the way to go. The best spoon to use is a yellow and gold Kamlooper. However,
other spoons like rainbow patterned Daredevils and junior Kamloopers also work,
just not as well as the yellow Kamlooper. Most of the fish are around 10", but
they can be as big as 15" and there is the occasional Wiper mixed in with the
Trout. <strong>(Report from: 10/23/19)</strong>

    Fishing has slowed a little, but there is still a lot of fish on the surface.
Fishing with spoons is still the way to go. However, you are going to want to use
some bigger spoons. The best spoons to use are: yellow and gold Kamloopers, fire
tiger or black and white Daredevils, and gold and red Pot-O-Golds.

    Water clarity is great and there is a lot of fish active on the surface near
shore. Fishing with spoons is pretty much the only way to catch these fish. The
best spoons to use are: red and white junior Kamloopers, fire tiger or rainbow
patterned Daredevils, and gold and red Pot-O-Golds. If you fish with bait on top
or bottom you will not catch anything. The same goes for fly fishing.
