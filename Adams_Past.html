  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Water clarity is great and there is a lot of fish active on the surface near
shore. Fishing with spoons is pretty much the only way to catch these fish. The
best spoons to use are: red and white junior Kamloopers, fire tiger or rainbow
patterned Daredevils, and gold and red Pot-O-Golds. If you fish with bait on top
or bottom you will not catch anything. The same goes for fly fishing.

    Due to a recnet stocking the fishing has picked up. Fishing Kamloopers or junior
Kamloopers is the way to go. The best colors to use are red, gold, and white or
yellow and gold. Orange and gold my also work, but due to the fact that the water
is no super clear it doesn't do as good as the other colors. <strong>(Report from: 9/26/19)</strong>

    Fishing is very slow right now mostly likely due to the warm temperatures.
We think in around a week or two the fishing will pick-up. <strong>(Report from: 9/12/19)</strong>
