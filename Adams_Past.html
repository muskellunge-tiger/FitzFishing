  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Due to a recnet stocking the fishing has picked up. Fishing Kamloopers or junior
Kamloopers is the way to go. The best colors to use are red, gold, and white or
yellow and gold. Orange and gold my also work, but due to the fact that the water
is no super clear it doesn't do as good as the other colors. <strong>(Report from: 9/26/19)</strong>

    Fishing is very slow right now mostly likely due to the warm temperatures.
We think in around a week or two the fishing will pick-up. <strong>(Report from: 9/12/19)</strong>
