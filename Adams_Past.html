  <h1>Adams Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Adams was recently stocked with planter sized Rainbows. The fishing is still
a little slow with spinners, and the pond is at max water capacity. We think that
in the near future the fishing will get better. <strong>(Report from: 4/1/19)</strong>

    Adams is now open to fishing until winter. However, the fact that the lake has
not been stocked since October of 2018 the fishing is horrible. It seems as if there
is no life in the lake. I saw numerus fishermen catch nothing. I would avoid this
area until it is re-stocked. <strong>(Report from: 3/20/19)</strong>
