  <h1>Rockport Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is great, and the water clarity is also quite good. There is a lot of
algae in the water, but it doesn't seem to hinder the fish's activity. Most of the
fish are on or very near the surface, so the spinner and spoon fishing is amazing.
The best spoons to use are Perch patterned Thunder Bolts or silver and green Pot-O-Golds.
Other spoons that work are yellow Kamloopers, fire tiger Daredevils, and gold
Castmasters. While the best way to catch them is casting, if you are having trouble
getting bites, trolling the spoons is a great way to catch and find where the fish
are at. We found that tube jigs and small swimbaits did not work. Most of the fish
are 13-15", but there are a few bigger and smaller ones around. <strong>(Report from: 10/2/19)</strong>
