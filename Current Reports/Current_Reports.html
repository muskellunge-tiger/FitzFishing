    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Good Ski</h3>
  <p>
    The pond is full and the water is relatively clear. However, the fishing is extremely
slow. We tried spinners, spoons, and  tube jigs of different sizes and colors with
no luck and only 3 hits. It seems there's a lot of bait fish in the pond however,
it looked to be that most of the Trout that were busting on the surface where a
long ways out. <strong>(Report From: 9/22/21)</strong>

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>

    The water temperature is 55 to 60 degrees depending on the time of day and
where you are on the lake. The summer to fall transition seems to be in full swing
right now, which means fishing is a little tough because a lot of the fish are spread
out in many different areas and depths. For us, the best depth seemed to be around
50'. The best methods continue to be tube jigs and spoons. The best tube jig continues
to be 2.5 to 3" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat. The best spoons are jumbo
orange and gold Kamloopers and yellow Apex Five of Diamonds, but large gold Pot-O-Golds,
and standard size Kamloopers will also work. In some cases, Lucky Craft 115's work
as well using a fast stop and go retrieve. <strong>(Report From: 9/21/21)</strong>

    The water level is very low, but the clarity is pretty good. Fishing is also
good right now with spoons. Bigger spoons seem to be working better at the moment,
the best spoon for us was a fire tiger Daredevl, but standard size yellow and gold
Kamloopers also worked. Most of the fish are still quite a ways out, so having
a bigger spoon is also good for distance. When fishing with the spoons, it seems
to be best to let the spoon sink all the way to the bottom before retrieving, and
sometimes the fish will hit right after it comes off the bottom. Most of the fish
a very small 5-8". <strong>(Report From: 9/20/21)</strong>

    Fishing is very slow right now. However, the water clarity is not too bad and
there are quite a few fish busting on the surface, they're just a little far out
right now, and the water temperature is still a little warm. The best lures to use
are spoons, the best spoons are fire tiger Daredevls and either yellow and gold
or white red and gold standard size Kamloopers.
