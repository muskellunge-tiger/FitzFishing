    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    The water level is not as low as most other places and is quite clear. The
fishing is also quite good as well for both Bluegill and Trout. For Bluegill, try
finding some sort of structure or cover near the shore and then use a small jig
or fly around it to catch some of the small gills, we used a small pink jig. For
Trout, small spoons seem to work best. We used a red white and gold junior Kamlooper.
Most of the fish are not far out sometimes, so making shoreline casts is usually
a great way to catch the fish. <strong>(Report From: 10/14/21)</strong>

    The water level and clarity hasn't changed much recently. However, there is
now some large schools of fish hanging very close to the shore, sometimes within
visible range. While the fish aren't completely in fall feeding mode yet, they
are starting to get there. Spoons are a great way to pick fish out of the close
running schools. The best spoons for us were junior white red and gold Kamloopers
and standard size yellow and gold Kamloopers. <strong>(Report From: 10/4/21)</strong>

    Water temperature is around the high 50's pretty much all day now. The summer
to fall transition is still happening, but some more fish are starting to work
their way up shallower. Spoons and tube jigs continue to be the best way to go.
The best tube jig continues to be a 2.5 to 3" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat.
The best spoons are jumbo and large silver Pot-O-Golds, yellow Apex five of diamonds,
and jumbo orange and gold Kamloopers. Most of the fish are in 40 to 50' of water.
