    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Good Ski</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is still fairly slow right now, but the lake is full and the water is
cool. The best method for us was fishing on the bottom with worm and a marshmallow.
You will have to cast a little farther because most of the fish are still out in the
deeper water, but we hope they will be moving in shallower in the coming weeks.
We tried spinners, spoons, and tube jigs as well, but with no luck.

  <h3>Pineview</h3>
  <p>
    The Crappie fishing is very fast right now. There are tons of large schools of
Crappie around the lake. The best jig for us was a 1" yellow atomic tube jig tipped
with either Perch meat or a pink maggot. When trying to find these schools, it
seemed that around 20 feet was the best depth. As for the Muskie fishing, it is
extremely slow. Due to the amount and size of the Crappie schools we believe that
a good portion of the Muskie have died because we did see multiple dead Muskie along
shorelines. <strong>(Report from: 8/27/20)</strong>
