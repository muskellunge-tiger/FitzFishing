    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    The lake is still mostly frozen, and the fishing is absolutely terrible. We saw
two groups catch two fish a piece and nothing else. We tried spinners, spoons,
tube jigs, bottom and bobber fishing with only 2 hits on the bottom, 1 hit on a
green Jake, and a follow on a Kamlooper. Beyond that, there was absolutely no action.

  <h3>Adams</h3>
  <p>
    The lake is now pretty much 100% full, but because there was a lot of water
put in the past few days the water is now very dirty. This pretty much makes it
impossible for spinners and spoons to work. We also saw a lot less fish activity
on the surface. <strong>(Report from: 4/3/20)</strong>

  <h3>Holmes</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is still extremely slow even through there is at times a lot of fish
surfacing near the shore. The only spinner that worked for us was a #2 sliver and
green Bluefox. We also got one hit on a fly, but beyond that there was nothing.

  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is kind of hit and miss right now. Most people tend to have little
success while others tend to have a little better. One factor that helps the bite
is if it is mostly sunny. If it is mostly cloudy then the fishing is a lot slower.
The only method that we found to consistently work was a bobber and half a worm.
A 1 to 2-foot leader is the best length at this time. We also tried many other
methods including: tube jigs, spinners, bottom, and flies with pretty much no
success. <strong>(Report from: 3/31/20)</strong>

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    The fishing has really improved over the past couple weeks. The best jigs to use
are yellow Atomic tubes, white Marabouâ€™s, and small white beetle jigs. Bigger tube
jigs don't tend to work as well because the fish seem to not be after larger bait
right now. We recommend that you tip your jigs with either nightcrawlers, wax worms,
or Chub meat. While most of the fish are around 15 to 40 feet of water, you want
to fish in water that is a little bit deeper, like 60+ feet. Most of the fish are
around 15". <strong>(Report from: 3/29/20)</strong>
