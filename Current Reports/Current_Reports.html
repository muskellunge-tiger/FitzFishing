    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Fishing is great. It seems a very good majority or fish are on the bottom right
now, so that is the best way to fish. We used two different methods for fishing
the bottom. The first, and most successful, was using half or a third of a worm
and half a marshmallow on a 6 to 18" leader. The second, was bottom bounding a
small pink and red tube jig tipped with a pink maggot. We also did see some fly
fishermen doing well in the early morning when some of the fish were near the
surface. <strong>(Report From: 3/18/21)</strong>

    Fishing is pretty slow right now. There is almost no method that works
consistently. We tried fishing multiple different jigs, on the bottom, and bobber
and a worm. We only caught a few fish on a bobber and a worm, and couple fish on
a few different jigs. Those being a small green tube jig, a small yellow Atomic
tube, and a small white beetle jig with a black jig head. It seems that if there
are clouds blocking the sun, it is extremely hard to almost impossible to catch
any fish. <strong>(Report From: 3/14/21)</strong>

    Fishing has improved a little bit. Smaller jigs are still the way to go most
of the time. The best jigs are small yellow Atomic tubs, 2" white beetle jigs with
a black jig head, and 2" green and white tube jigs. We tipped all our jigs with
either Chub meat or wax worms. It seemed that the fish were shallower in the
morning and deeper in the afternoon. We were in about 45 feet in the morning and
moved to about 55 feet in the afternoon. <strong>(Report From: 3/11/21)</strong>
