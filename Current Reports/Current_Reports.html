    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Water temperature is still around 70 degrees all day. Fishing has slowed a
little, but it's still quite fast. 2.5 to 3" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat
continue to be the best way to catch the most fish in the shortest time. Jigging
and casting both continue to work great, but it seems jigging is doing at little
better right now probably due to the warmer water because you can let your jig sit
and one spot for a while and let the less active fish still have a chance at the
lure. Most of the fish are suspended in about 55 to 65' and about 35 to 45' feet
down. <strong>(Report From: 8/5/21)</strong>
