    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    The water level has come up some and the clarity has dropped too. However,
fishing is still okay. Most of the fish are on or near the bottom now most of the
time, so bottom fishing with bait or bottom bouncing jigs are what will work best.
For bottom fishing, worm and a marshmallow on about a 1 to 1.5' leader is the best,
and for jigs, a small white beetle jig tipped with a pink maggot is the way to go.
The fish are not very far out right now, so you don't need to cast bottom gear
out very far to have success. <strong>(Report From: 11/3/21)</strong>

    Fishing red hot right now. The fish are very active and in full fall feeding.
Multiple different methods work very well to catch all sorts of different species.
The first, and hottest method, is bottom fishing with a worm and a marshmallow on
about a 1.5' leader. The second method that works is casting and slowly retrieving
small jigs tipped with either worm or pink maggots. The best jigs for us were small
yellow Atomic tubes and small white beetle jigs. The jigs are the better way to
catch the bigger more aggressive fish, while bottom fishing is the better way to
catch smaller fish and more species. But both methods are capable of catch either.

    The water temperature is in the high 40s pretty much all day now. Fishing
remains good as well. Spoons, tube jigs, and hard baits work the best. For spoons,
yellow Apex 5 of Diamonds, gold Pot-O-Gold, and yellow and gold or orange and gold
Kamloopers all work the best. For tube jigs, a 2.5-3" white jig tipped with Chub
meat works the best. Other lures like Lucky craft 115s will also work very well using
a fast stop and go retrieve when casting. Along with casting, the Lucky craftâ€™s
and spoons also work trolling at around 2 to 3 MPH.

    The water clarity is still really good, and fish activity is still okay on the
surface, but the fishing is slowing down. Some spinners and spoons still work but
not as good as they were a few weeks ago. The best spoon is a red white and gold
junior Kamlooper and the best spinner is a green Li'l Jake.

  <h3>Farmington</h3>
  <p>
    The water is very clear and fish activity is high on the surface. However, the
fishing seemed to be a bit slow with spinners and spoons. While spoons like Kamloopers,
Pot-O-Golds, and Daredevls and spinners like lil' Jakes worked, the fish didn't
seem to really be hitting them well even though there was a ton on the surface.
This might partly be due to the fact that there is a ton of grass still very close
to the surface from the hot summer and low water level, so most spinners and spoons
would get hung up in the grass very easily. Right now, it seemed that other anglers
were having success fishing on the bottom with bait.
