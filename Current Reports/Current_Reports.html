    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is beginning to slow down a little probably due to the fact that it
is getting late in the season. The best method right now is casting a 2.5" white
tube jig tipped with Chub meat. The other method that works is fishing on the
bottom with worm and a marshmallow on a 1 to 3' leader. Most of the fish are close
to the shore, so you do not have to cast out very far at all to catch the fish.

  <h3>Good Ski Lake</h3>
  <p>
    The water clarity is very good right now, and there seems to be a lot of fish
activity, but the fishing isn't that great right now. Bottom fishing a worm and a
marshmallow was what worked best for us. Bottom bouncing a tube jig got us a few
hits and 1 one fish and spinners did nothing. So, overall, the fishing is not that
hot at the moment. <strong>(Report From: 11/12/21)</strong>

  <h3>Holmes</h3>
  <p>
    The water level has come up some and the clarity has dropped too. However,
fishing is still okay. Most of the fish are on or near the bottom now most of the
time, so bottom fishing with bait or bottom bouncing jigs are what will work best.
For bottom fishing, worm and a marshmallow on about a 1 to 1.5' leader is the best,
and for jigs, a small white beetle jig tipped with a pink maggot is the way to go.
The fish are not very far out right now, so you don't need to cast bottom gear
out very far to have success. <strong>(Report From: 11/3/21)</strong>
