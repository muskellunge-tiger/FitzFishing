    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Fishing is fairly slow right now. The water tempurature is around 55 to 58

40 to 60 feet of water. The best lure to use is a 2" white tube jig with a 3/8oz.
head tipped with Chub or Sucker meat. The best way to catch the fish with the tube
jig is to cast or jig. Trolling pop gear or dodger with a a worm or small pink
squid. Spinners and spoons didn't work for us even though there was a fair amount
of fish breaking the surface. <strong>(Report from: 6/6/20)</strong>
