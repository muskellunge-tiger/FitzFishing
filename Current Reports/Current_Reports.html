    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <p>
    Fishing is still slow most likely due to the still very dirty water. While a
lot of fish are breaking the surface because of the dirty water it makes it hard
for them to see spinners and spoons most of the time. The spinners and spoons
that occasionally work are silver and green #2 Bluefox's, fire tiger or black
and white Daredevls, and red and white junior Kamloopers.

    Fishing is extremely slow right now. We used tube jigs, Marabou's, spinners,
and spoons with no fish or even any bites. We also saw other anglers fishing with
bobbers and on the bottom with no luck as well. <strong>(Report from: 10/9/20)</strong>

    Fishing for the most part is very fast. The only strange thing is that one day
you can catch over 100 fish and the next struggle to catch 30 to 40 with the same
weather conditions. Spoons are still the way to go. The best spoons now are large
Pot-O-Golds with the best colors being: gold, silver, silver and green, gold and
red/orange, and silver and orange. If smaller fish are following the larger
Pot-O-Golds, but not biting, then it is best to use the next size down but still use the
same color. Kamloopers also work well, the best colors for Kamloopers are: orange
and gold, red and silver, and yellow and gold. Like the Pot-O-Golds if you are only
getting follows on the jumbo Kamloopers then downsizing to a standard Kamlooper
will be the best option. Another spoon that will sometimes work is a yellow Apex
Five of Diamonds. If the spoons aren't working then Lucky Craft 115's or 2 to 3"
white twisty tail or tube jigs tipped with Chub meat will also work.

    Fishing is extremely slow for Trout. We tried multiple different spinners,
spoons, and jigs and we only caught fish by bottom bouncing a small green and white
Marabou. <strong>(Report from: 10/5/20)</strong>
