    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    The water clarity is stained and itâ€™s cold. The fishing is a little slow, but we
hope that when the water warms up a little it will pick up. Spinners and spoons
work fairly well right now. The best spinner was a silver and green #2 Bluefox and
the best spoon was a red, white, and gold junior Kamlooper. Of those two the Bluefox
was definitely better. Other spinners like #1 silver and green Bluefox's and lil
green Jakes also worked, but not as well. <strong>(Report From: 4/2/21)</strong>

    The ice is still plenty thick to walk on. However, on warmer afternoons, the top
does start to melt so it does get a little wet, but it's nothing too serious right
now. Fishing is still good, and smaller jigs are still the way to go. The jig that
dominated for us was a 2" white beetle jig with a black jig head tipped with
either wax worm or Chub meat. Yellow Atomic tubes and small white Trout magnet jigs
also worked well for fish that were higher in the water (15 feet or less). We also
found that if you are having trouble seeing fish, to either move or consistently
jig your jig to bring fish in. <strong>(Report From: 4/1/21)</strong>

    Water clarity is pretty good and the water temperature is cold as well. Fishing
is slow right now, but because there was a recent stocking, we are hoping that the
fishing will get better once the water warms up a little more. The best lures for
us were a red, white, and gold junior Kamlooper and a #2 silver and green Bluefox.
We also had some bites and follows on a lil green Jake and some small tube jigs.
We also tried flies, but with no success. <strong>(Report From: 3/31/21)</strong>
