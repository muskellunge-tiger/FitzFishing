    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Water clarity is okay right now, and the fishing is hit and miss. Spoons and
spinners are the best option. The best spinner is a sliver and green #2 Bluefox,
but green Jake's will also sometimes work. The best spoon is a red and white junior
Kamlooper, but fire tiger Daredevls and red Thunderbolt's will also work but they
are a little big for the fish, so you might get some hits but have a hard time
hooking up. <strong>(Report from: 9/30/20)</strong>

    Fishing has really picked up, and the water temperature is around the mid to
upper 50s all day. Spoons are the best way to go to catch the most fish quickly.
The best spoon is a jumbo gold and orange Kamlooper. Other spoons that work are
red and white spoons or large gold or silver Pot-O-Golds. The spoons seem to work
weather it is calm or windy. Another method to use while it's windy is to fish
2.5" white tube jigs around 20 to 25 feet down while you are fishing with spoons
to increase your catch number even more. If done right, it is possible to catch
100+ fish in a day. <strong>(Report from: 9/27/20)</strong>

    Due to the storm last weekend, the water clarity has really worsened. And
because of this, the water is now a little warmer as well. While there are a lot
of fish surfacing, because of the poor water clarity it is extremely hard to catch
them on spinners and spoons. The spoons that worked were fire tiger or black and
white Daredevls. We also tried tube jigs and saw people fly fishing and bottom
fishing with little to no luck as well. Fishing should get better again once the
water clears up and cools back down. <strong>(Report from: 9/23/20)</strong>

    The Muskie fishing is still very slow. We were able to see some Muskie
swimming along the surface, but weren't able to catch them. While the Crappie fishing
seems to have slowed, the Perch fishing is red hot. The best lure to use is a small
yellow Atomic tube jig tipped with Perch meat. The best depth range to target is
around 12 to 16 feet. Most of the time the Perch will either be on the bottom or
very close to it. Because of this, you are also able to catch quite a few Catfish.
