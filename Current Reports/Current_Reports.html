    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Water temperature is around 60 to 65 degrees depending on the time of day,
and the fishing is excellent. The best method for us was either casting or jigging
2-3" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat. Most of the fish seemed to be in about
45 to 50' of water while the water temperature was closer to 60 and then around
60 to 70' when the water got warmer. <strong>(Report From: 6/16/21)</strong>

    Fishing is good for Catfish and Wiper right now. The best thing to do is fish
on the bottom with 1/4 to 1/2 worm and half a marshmallow on about a 12 to 18"
leader. Most of the Catfish are very small and the occasional Wipers are also
small. <strong>(Report From: 6/8/21)</strong>
