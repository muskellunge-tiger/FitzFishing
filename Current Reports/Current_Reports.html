    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    Due to the storms and cooler temperatures the past couple days, the water
temperature has dropped and now hangs around 64 to 65 degrees instead of 70. Fishing
is still a little slower, but it has improved a bit from the cooler temperatures.
2.5 to 3" white tube jigs on a 3/8oz. jig head tipped with Chub meat is still the
way to go. Casting and jigging both work well, but at times one will do better
than the other. Most of the fish are shallower, but suspended in deeper water. It
seemed that 60 to 65 feet was the best depth, and the fish would be hanging around
35 to 45 feet. <strong>(Report From: 8/20/21)</strong>

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    The water level is really low, but the fishing is really good for Chub even
from shore. You do not have to cast out far to catch a ton of Chub in a short amount
of time. While this may not seem like the best quality fishing because it is Chub
only it is still fun and if you use Chub for bait during other fishing trips, this
is a great opportunity to get a lot of meat stocked up. The best way to catch them
is to use either a 1 or 2 single hook rig with a small snap weight below both hooks
for a little weight to cast tipped with a small piece of worm. After casting out
let the rig sink to the bottom and if you're in the right area you should be
getting hits within seconds. <strong>(Report From: 8/15/21)</strong>
