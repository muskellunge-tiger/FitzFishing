    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    The water level is fairly high and the water is cool. The fishing is also fairly
good. Spoons and spinners are the best options right now, but the spoons are the
better of the two. The best spoons to use are silver or gold and red Pot-O-Golds,
fire tiger Daredevls, and sometimes junior Kamloopers will work too. The best
spinners to use are silver or green lil Jakes. When using the spinners or spoons,
it is best to let it sink a little before retrieving because some of the fish are
still not eating right on the surface yet. <strong>(Report from: 9/16/20)</strong>

    Fishing is fair to slow. The water clarity is pretty good considering how warm
it has been. There are a lot of fish surfacing, so spinners and spoons are the
way to go. The best spoons are fire tiger Daredevls and yellow and gold Kamloopers.
The best spinner is a silver and green number 2 Bluefox. Some fish are very close
to shore, so making shoreline casts is usually the best way to go. While the fishing
may not be as good right now, we believe that it will get much better in the coming
weeks. <strong>(Report from: 9/15/20)</strong>

    Fishing is pretty good right now. The water temperature in the morning is around
55 degrees and it's around 60 degrees by the afternoon. Spoons seem to be the best
lures to use. The best spoons to use are jumbo gold and red Kamloopers or gold
Pot-O-Gold's. A slower retrieve is best right now as the fish are not quite in
full fall feeding mode. The best depths to fish are around 40 to 45 feet, but if
you see fish surfacing in an area then it is best to fish that area instead.

    The water is extremely clear, but the lake level is fairly low. The fishing
is extremely slow as well. While fish do tend to hit the surface quite often, they
will not touch a spinner or spoon. The only lure that gave us success was bottom
bouncing a small yellow tube jig tipped with a pink maggot.
