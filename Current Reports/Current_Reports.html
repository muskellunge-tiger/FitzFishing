    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Fishing has really slowed after the cold front. Spinners and spoons pretty much
don't work anymore. Bottom fishing with either half a worm and half a marshmallow
or powerbait is pretty much the only way to catch fish.

    Fishing is still red hot. The water temperature is around 50 degrees all day
now. Spoons still work extremely well, but tube jigs are also beginning to work
very well too. The best spoon is a yellow or orange Apex Five of Diamonds with
red diamonds on it. Other spoons that work well are jumbo red and orange Kamloopers,
yellow and gold standard size Kamloopers, and large silver and green Pot-O-Golds.
When using tube jigs, 2 to 2.5" white tube jigs with a 3/8oz jig head tipped with
either nightcrawler or Chub meat works best. It is best to jig or drift troll the
tube jigs instead of casting them. If it is windy, it is best to cast the spoons
and drift troll the tube jigs at the same time to maximize your catching.

    Fishing is still slow most likely due to the still very dirty water. While a
lot of fish are breaking the surface because of the dirty water it makes it hard
for them to see spinners and spoons most of the time. The spinners and spoons
that occasionally work are silver and green #2 Bluefox's, fire tiger or black
and white Daredevls, and red and white junior Kamloopers.
