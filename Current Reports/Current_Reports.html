    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is a little better now, but still slow. The best methods for us were
a 2" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat and fishing on the bottom with half a
worm and half or whole marshmallow. Spoons like Kamloopers would also work just
not as well. If you do use spinners or spoons, make sure to retrieve them very
slowly as the fish are not to fired up yet. <strong>(Report from: 4/18/20)</strong>

  <h3>Hobbs</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is still very slow. Pretty much nothing works well. We tried all shorts
spinners, spoons, tube jigs, and flies with very little luck. It may just be best
to wait until another stocking happens for the fishing to improve.

  <h3>Good Ski</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is fairly slow. The best methods to use are bottom fishing with half
a worm and half a marshmallow or using a bobber and half a worm. When using the
bobber it is best to put the worm about 2 feet below the bobber. Spinners will
also sometimes work. The best spinners were Liâ€™l sliver and green Jakes.

  <h3>Farmington</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is a little slow right now. Pretty much the only method that works is
fishing on the bottom with either half a worm and half a marshmallow, chartreuse
powerbait, or a whole marshmallow. Most of the fish are small, so it can be difficult
at times to hook them. <strong>(Report from: 4/9/20)</strong>
