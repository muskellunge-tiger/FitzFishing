    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Fishing is really good right now for panfish. The best jigs to use are small
yellow or red tube jigs tipped with either pink maggots or Perch meat. It is still
possible to catch fish without tipping your jigs, but if you add Perch meat then the
fish seem to bite more and faster. Most of the schools of fish are near the bottom
right now. If school is Crappie then it is best to drop the jig to the bottom,
then bring it up 2 to 3 feet and do a mixture of dead-sticking and jigging to get
bites. If the school is Perch then dropping the jig to the bottom and then reeling
till the line is tight and just waiting for the Perch to pick it up off the bottom
is the best option. As for the Muskie fishing, it is very slow right now. We think
this is mainly due to the lack of cover and structure in the water because the water
level is a little lower right now. <strong>(Report from: 8/12/20)</strong>

    Fishing is still really good. The fish now seem to be in large schools, so
once you find them you are usually able to catch a lot in a short period of time.
The best lure to use is 2.5 to 3.5" white tube jigs tipped with Chub meat. Because
the fish are in larger schools, jigging is usually the best method to go to, but
casting will also work well too. We also recommend just dropping a jig down as a
dead stick to increase the odds of catching fish. This is also helpful if you want
to cast your jig, but also still have a jigging rod out as well. The water
temperature right now is in the low 70s. <strong>(Report from: 8/2/20)</strong>
