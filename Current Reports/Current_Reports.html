    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is pretty good right now. The only method that we found to work was
trolling either pop gear and a worm or a flatfish. The best pop gear to use was
silver and gold willow leaf or multi-colored Colorado blade pop gear. When fishing
with the flatfish, the only color we found to work was yellow. We also tried jigging
tube jigs and casting spoons, but with no success. <strong>(Report from: 5/28/20)</strong>

  <h3>Pineview</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is a little slow. Muskie fishing is not the best option right now.
However, the Crappie and Perch fishing is pretty good, especially the Crappie.
Most of the fish are in about 20 to 25 feet of water, and they are usually right
on or near the bottom. The best lure for us was a small white Marabouâ€™s tipped with
a pink maggot. Other lures that worked were small green and brown tube jigs also
tipped with pink maggots. <strong>(Report from: 5/8/20)</strong>
