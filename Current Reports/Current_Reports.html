    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h3>East Canyon</h3>

    Fishing is extremely slow right now. The water temperature is 66 to 71 degrees
depending on the time of day. Most of the fish seem to be really spread out,
and if you do find a small group of fish, they tend to not bite anything. We tried
multiple different lures and methods from trolling to tube jigs to crankbaits
and spoons. We only caught fish while trolling silver willow leaf or tomahawk pop
gear and a worm and a small white and green Marabou.

    The lake is pretty much full, but the fishing is very slow. Almost nothing
consistently works. The method that works the best is trolling silver or gold
willow leaf pop gear and a worm. Silver spoons will also sometimes work in the
mornings, but don't work in the afternoon. Tube jigs will sometimes get bites,
but right now, they are the worst of the three.

    Fishing is really improving. The best lure to use is still a 2" white tube jig
with a 3/8oz. head tipped with Chub or Sucker meat. Other lures that work are small
Lucky Crafts and spoons or spinners. Trolling pop gear and worm can be a great
way to catch a good amount of fish as well if the artificial bite is not working.
Generally, if it's calm or mostly calm then the artificialâ€™s will work best, and
while it is windy then trolling seems to work best.
