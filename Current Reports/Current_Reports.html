    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Good Ski Lake</h3>
  <p>
    The water clarity is very good right now, and there seems to be a lot of fish
activity, but the fishing isn't that great right now. Bottom fishing a worm and a
marshmallow was what worked best for us. Bottom bouncing a tube jig got us a few
hits and 1 one fish and spinners did nothing. So, overall, the fishing is not that
hot at the moment. <strong>(Report From: 11/12/21)</strong>

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is really good right now from shore. There a ton of Cutthroats and
other Trout species that are very close to shore. There is plenty of methods that
work to catch these fish as well ranging from bottom fishing, to tube jigs and spoons,
and bobbers. The two best of these methods is bottom fishing and jig fishing. For
bottom fishing, worm and marshmallow on 1 to 3' leader is the best. For jig fishing,
2.5" white and pearl tube jigs and large white beetle jigs tipped with Chub meat
work the best. There are also times where spoon fishing will work too, and the best
spoons for us were either yellow and gold or red white and gold Kamloopers. And
finally, bobber fishing which was the slowest for us, we used small white beetle
jigs and small yellow Atomic tubes about 1 to 2' below the bobber tipped with
pink maggots or salmon eggs. <strong>(Report From: 11/7/21)</strong>

  <h3>Holmes</h3>
  <p>
    The water level has come up some and the clarity has dropped too. However,
fishing is still okay. Most of the fish are on or near the bottom now most of the
time, so bottom fishing with bait or bottom bouncing jigs are what will work best.
For bottom fishing, worm and a marshmallow on about a 1 to 1.5' leader is the best,
and for jigs, a small white beetle jig tipped with a pink maggot is the way to go.
The fish are not very far out right now, so you don't need to cast bottom gear
out very far to have success. <strong>(Report From: 11/3/21)</strong>

  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing red hot right now. The fish are very active and in full fall feeding.
Multiple different methods work very well to catch all sorts of different species.
The first, and hottest method, is bottom fishing with a worm and a marshmallow on
about a 1.5' leader. The second method that works is casting and slowly retrieving
small jigs tipped with either worm or pink maggots. The best jigs for us were small
yellow Atomic tubes and small white beetle jigs. The jigs are the better way to
catch the bigger more aggressive fish, while bottom fishing is the better way to
catch smaller fish and more species. But both methods are capable of catch either.
