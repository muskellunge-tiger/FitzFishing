    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Fishing was very slow. We not only had a hard time catching fish, but we also
had a hard time just seeing fish in general. The jigs that kind of worked the best
were small white or green jigs. Other jigs that would also sometimes work were
green and white or blue pearl pepper tube jigs. We tipped all our jigs with either
a wax worm or Chub meat. <strong>(Report From: 3/2/21)</strong>

    The pond is ice free, and the fishing is good. The fish seem to be hitting
best on the bottom right now. So, bottom fishing with bait is the best way to go.
The bait that worked for us was a fourth to a half a worm with half a marshmallow
on a 6 to 18" leader. We tried casting spinners and tube jigs as well as bottom
bouncing the jigs and only got one bait using those methods.

  <h3>Pineview</h3>
  <p>
    The ice is still plenty thick to walk on, around 10 to 12" not including the
couple inches of slush on top of the ice. However, the edges are starting to get
fairly soft, and to the point that you could break through in some areas later in
the day. Fishing has slowed at little, but it is still fairly good. The fish seem
to be around 40 feet of water now. The best lures to use are small green or fire
tiger ice flies tipped with either Perch meat, a Perch eye, or wax worms. We have
found that wax worms are the most consistent at getting bites. The fish are pretty
much always going to be on the bottom. <strong>(Report From: 2/9/21)</strong>
