    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Water temperature is about 62 to 63 degrees in the morning and around 65 to
66 degrees in the afternoon. Most of the fish are still in a summer to fall transition,
but they are beginning to move up into shallower water and higher in the water
column now that the temperatures are dropping. Most of the fish are 20 to 35' down
and suspended in about 50 to 55' most of the time. 2.5 to 3" white tube jigs tipped
with Chub meat continue to work very well, but spoons are also beginning to work
as well. The best spoons for us were standard size Kamloopers that had gold as
some part of their coloring. The best Kamlooper was a standard size orange and
gold. We expect that in the next couple weeks the spoon fishing will increase a
lot when the fish get into full fall feeding.

    Fishing is very slow right now. However, the water clarity is not too bad and
there are quite a few fish busting on the surface, they're just a little far out
right now, and the water temperature is still a little warm. The best lures to use
are spoons, the best spoons are fire tiger Daredevls and either yellow and gold
or white red and gold standard size Kamloopers.
