    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    The water has come up from the recent storms and the water clarity has improved
as well. However, the fishing is still not great with spinners and spoons. There
is a lot of Bluegill near shore and some Trout are running close as well, but the
action wasn't red hot. The best spoons that worked for us was a red white and gold
junior Kamlooper, fire tiger daredevl, and either a silver and green or gold and
orange Pot-O-Gold. <strong>(Report From: 10/21/21)</strong>

    The water temperature is around 48 to 52 degrees all day, and the fall fishing
is in full swing. Pretty much all the fish have moved up shallow and are beginning
to fatten up for the winter. Spoons and tube jigs work the best depending on the
time of day. Spoons worked best in the morning and early afternoon while tube jigs
did better in the late afternoon and evening. The best spoons for us were yellow
Apex 5 of diamonds, yellow and gold Kamloopers, and silver and green Pot-O-Gold's.
The best tube jig was 2.5-to-3-inch white tube jig tipped with Chub meat. Most
of the fish are very close to shore early in the day then began to move out a little
later in the day before moving back up in the evening.

    The water level is not as low as most other places and is quite clear. The
fishing is also quite good as well for both Bluegill and Trout. For Bluegill, try
finding some sort of structure or cover near the shore and then use a small jig
or fly around it to catch some of the small gills, we used a small pink jig. For
Trout, small spoons seem to work best. We used a red white and gold junior Kamlooper.
Most of the fish are not far out sometimes, so making shoreline casts is usually
a great way to catch the fish. <strong>(Report From: 10/14/21)</strong>
