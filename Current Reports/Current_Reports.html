    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>
  <h3>Kaysville</h3>
  <p>
    Catfish fishing is very good right now. The best bait to use is worm and half
a marshmallow. Because the fish tend to be very small, it is best to only use a
fourth of a worm for bait and a smaller hook, so the fish can get it in there mouth
easier. <strong>(Report from: 7/14/20)</strong>

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is fairly good right now, but mainly in morning. By the afternoon the
bite really dies off. The best methods to use are trolling and jigging. When trolling,
silver willow leaf or tomahawk bladed pop gear with a worm works the best. When
jigging, smaller tube jigs work better. 1.5-2" skinny white and green tube jigs
work best. Most of the fish we caught were around 11 to 14 inches.

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is very good right now. The water temperature is mainly in the low 60's.
The best method is casting or jigging a 2" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat.
Spoons will also sometimes work as well. The best spoons to use are yellow and
gold or orange and gold Kamloopers. The best depths to target are 40 to 60 feet.

  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is extremely slow right now. The water temperature is 66 to 71 degrees
depending on the time of day. Most of the fish seem to be really spread out,
and if you do find a small group of fish, they tend to not bite anything. We tried
multiple different lures and methods from trolling to tube jigs to crankbaits
and spoons. We only caught fish while trolling silver willow leaf or tomahawk pop
gear and a worm and a small white and green Marabou.
