    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Fishing has improved a little bit. Smaller jigs are still the way to go most
of the time. The best jigs are small yellow Atomic tubs, 2" white beetle jigs with
a black jig head, and 2" green and white tube jigs. We tipped all our jigs with
either Chub meat or wax worms. It seemed that the fish were shallower in the
morning and deeper in the afternoon. We were in about 45 feet in the morning and
moved to about 55 feet in the afternoon. <strong>(Report From: 3/11/21)</strong>

    Fishing is fair to slow right now. The fish seem to be feeding on bottom and
on top. So, bottom fishing and tube jig fishing is the best way to go. For the
bottom, half or a thrid of a worm and half a marshmallow on a 6 to 18" leader works
best. For the jigs, small green or pink jigs tipped with a pink maggot work best.
We recommend fishing on sunny and calm days especially if you plan on fishing with
the jigs. <strong>(Report From: 3/8/21)</strong>

    The pond is ice free, and the fishing is good. The fish seem to be hitting
best on the bottom right now. So, bottom fishing with bait is the best way to go.
The bait that worked for us was a fourth to a half a worm with half a marshmallow
on a 6 to 18" leader. We tried casting spinners and tube jigs as well as bottom
bouncing the jigs and only got one bait using those methods.
