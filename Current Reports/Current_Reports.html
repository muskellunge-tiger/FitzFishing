    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    Water temperature is around 70 degrees the entire day now. However, the fishing
is still red hot. 2.5-3" white tube jigs are still the way to. You also don't have
to tip your jigs with anything, but we still recommend tipping your jigs with Chub
meat. Most of the fish are suspended in about 35 to 45' in 55 to 60' feet of water.
