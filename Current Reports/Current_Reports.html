    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing does seem to be beginning to slow from shore. The Trout only seem to
be shallow in the early morning, and then head offshore by the afternoon, and only
a few Trout and mostly Chub seem to remain near shore. The only method that still
works is fishing on the bottom with half a worm and marshmallow on about a 1 to 4'
leader. <strong>(Report From: 5/18/21)</strong>

  <h3>East Canyon</h3>
  <p>
    The water temperature is around 51 to 55 degrees depending on the time of day,
and the fishing is really good. There are multiple different methods that work.
The first, is casting spoons and spinners. This will really only work in the morning
and the best lures use are junior red white and gold Kamloopers and silver Jake's. The
next method is jigging or drift trolling small jigs. The best jigs to use are white
beetle bugs or trout magnets and small green tube jigs. If jigging always just
"dead-stick" the jig when a fish comes to it. The final method is trolling pop gear
and dodgers with a worm. The best pop gears are 4 bladed silver or gold willow leaf,
5 bladed Colorado multi-color. And silver dodgers will also work as well. Most of
the fish are in shallower water right now so using weight or down-riggers for
trolling is not really needed right now. <strong>(Report From: 5/13/21)</strong>

  <h3>Holmes</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is still pretty good with spoons. Most of the fish are still pretty
far offshore so using larger spoons remains the way to go. The best spoon right
now seems to be a fire tiger Daredevl, and a junior red, white, and gold Kamlooper
will also still work but not as well because it can't cast as far out as the Daredevl.
