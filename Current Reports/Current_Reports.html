    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    The Muskie fishing is still very slow. We were able to see some Muskie
swimming along the surface, but weren't able to catch them. While the Crappie fishing
seems to have slowed, the Perch fishing is red hot. The best lure to use is a small
yellow Atomic tube jig tipped with Perch meat. The best depth range to target is
around 12 to 16 feet. Most of the time the Perch will either be on the bottom or
very close to it. Because of this, you are also able to catch quite a few Catfish.

    The fishing has really slowed over the past few days. It seems most of the
Trout are now near the bottom, and are not hitting spinners and spoons near as
good as they were. It is still possible to catch them on silver or cooper Pot-O-Gold's,
but pretty much every other spinner or spoon didn't work.

    Fishing is fair to slow. The water clarity is pretty good considering how warm
it has been. There are a lot of fish surfacing, so spinners and spoons are the
way to go. The best spoons are fire tiger Daredevls and yellow and gold Kamloopers.
The best spinner is a silver and green number 2 Bluefox. Some fish are very close
to shore, so making shoreline casts is usually the best way to go. While the fishing
may not be as good right now, we believe that it will get much better in the coming
weeks. <strong>(Report from: 9/15/20)</strong>

    Fishing is pretty good right now. The water temperature in the morning is around
55 degrees and it's around 60 degrees by the afternoon. Spoons seem to be the best
lures to use. The best spoons to use are jumbo gold and red Kamloopers or gold
Pot-O-Gold's. A slower retrieve is best right now as the fish are not quite in
full fall feeding mode. The best depths to fish are around 40 to 45 feet, but if
you see fish surfacing in an area then it is best to fish that area instead.
