    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 4 weeks. After a lake or pond reaches more than 3 reports
the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it has been up. There will
be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but you can find the others in the
Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which new reports are entered may very
depending on the time of year.

    Fishing is still slow. The only color that we found to work was red. The best
lures to use were red Jakes, red, white, and gold Kamloopers, and small red
lipless crankbaits. The only other color that has a chance of working is green.
At this time, it is best to use bigger spinners and spoons in order to catch fish.

    Fishing is still fairly slow. While there are still fish jumping near shore,
spinners and spoons still don't work that well. The only spinner that got hit for
us was a red Jake. Another method that worked was fishing on the bottom with a
small piece of rainbow powerbait with about a 1-foot leader.

    Fishing is a little better now, but still slow. The best methods for us were
a 2" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat and fishing on the bottom with half a
worm and half or whole marshmallow. Spoons like Kamloopers would also work just
not as well. If you do use spinners or spoons, make sure to retrieve them very
slowly as the fish are not to fired up yet. <strong>(Report from: 4/18/20)</strong>
