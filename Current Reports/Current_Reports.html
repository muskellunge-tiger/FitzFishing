    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

    The water level and clarity hasn't changed much recently. However, there is
now some large schools of fish hanging very close to the shore, sometimes within
visible range. While the fish aren't completely in fall feeding mode yet, they
are starting to get there. Spoons are a great way to pick fish out of the close
running schools. The best spoons for us were junior white red and gold Kamloopers
and standard size yellow and gold Kamloopers. <strong>(Report From: 10/4/21)</strong>

    Water temperature is around the high 50's pretty much all day now. The summer
to fall transition is still happening, but some more fish are starting to work
their way up shallower. Spoons and tube jigs continue to be the best way to go.
The best tube jig continues to be a 2.5 to 3" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat.
The best spoons are jumbo and large silver Pot-O-Golds, yellow Apex five of diamonds,
and jumbo orange and gold Kamloopers. Most of the fish are in 40 to 50' of water.

    The water level has dropped a little more, but the clarity remains pretty good.
Fishing has slowed a little because of the warmer temperatures recently, and
most of the fish are quite a ways off shore, but are still within casting range of
larger spoons. The best spoons right now are yellow and gold standard size Kamloopers
and fire tiger Daredevls. It is best to let your spoon sink to the bottom before
retrieving because the fish are also close to the bottom where it is cooler as
well. Most of the time the fish will hit right after you start retrieving the
spoon off the bottom. <strong>(Report From: 9/27/21)</strong>

    Water clarity hasn't really changed much, and fishing is still slow with spinners
and spoons. There is a lot of fish surfacing very close to shore, but they don't
seem to be at the point where most of them are chasing spinners and spoons. The
spinners that worked for us were lil Jakes, and the best color was green.
