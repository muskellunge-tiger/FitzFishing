    Welcome to the Current Reports page. This page will provide fishing reports
from recent trips that we have made to lakes and ponds. There will be up to 4 reports
provided on this page. If you would like to see past reports for individual lakes
and ponds please go to the Past Reports page. A report will be removed from this
page regardless of the circumstances after 3 weeks, and reports from the past reports
page will be removed after 1 month. After a lake or pond in the past reports reaches
more than 3 reports the oldest report will be removed regardless of the time it
has been up. There will be no duplicated lakes on the Current Reports part, but
you can find the others in the Past Reports. Please know that the rate in which
new reports are entered may very depending on the time of year.

  <h2>Reports</h2>

    Fishing is extremely good right now with tube jigs. The best tube jigs to use
are 2.5 to 3.5" white tipped with Chub meat. However, there are times where Chub
meat may not be needed, but to ensure good consistent action tipping your jigs will
be the best idea. The spinner and spoon bite has really died off now. This is
most likely due to the warmer water temperatures. The water temperature right now
is mainly in the mid-60s. <strong>(Report from: 7/17/20)</strong>

    Catfish fishing is very good right now. The best bait to use is worm and half
a marshmallow. Because the fish tend to be very small, it is best to only use a
fourth of a worm for bait and a smaller hook, so the fish can get it in there mouth
easier. <strong>(Report from: 7/14/20)</strong>

  <h3>Lost Creek</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is fairly good right now, but mainly in morning. By the afternoon the
bite really dies off. The best methods to use are trolling and jigging. When trolling,
silver willow leaf or tomahawk bladed pop gear with a worm works the best. When
jigging, smaller tube jigs work better. 1.5-2" skinny white and green tube jigs
work best. Most of the fish we caught were around 11 to 14 inches.

  <h3>Strawberry</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing is very good right now. The water temperature is mainly in the low 60's.
The best method is casting or jigging a 2" white tube jig tipped with Chub meat.
Spoons will also sometimes work as well. The best spoons to use are yellow and
gold or orange and gold Kamloopers. The best depths to target are 40 to 60 feet.
