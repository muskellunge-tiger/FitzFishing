  <h1>East Canyon Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The reservoir is full and the fishing is hot. Water temp in the morning is
around 55 degrees, and warms up to around 59 degrees in the afternoon. Trolling
pop gear without weight 100 feet behind the boat at around 1 mph. is the best way
to catch fish right now. The best pop gear for us was, 4 bladed silver or gold
willow leaf. Triangle gold, silver, and green flashers also worked. We tried casting
spoons, crankbaits, and jigs but had no luck. Most of the fish where 13 to 16 inches
with a few smaller and bigger ones. <strong>(Report from: 6/3/19)</strong>
