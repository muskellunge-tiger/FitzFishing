  <h1>Lost Creek Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is still good from shore, but is slowing down most likely due to the
temperatures getting colder. The bite on artificial lures has pretty much stopped.
You can still catch a few fish with a tube jig. The best methods to use are worm
with a bobber on about a 2 to 3-foot leader or half a worm and half a marshmallow on
the bottom. Most of the fish are around 15 inches long. <strong>(Report from: 11/24/19)</strong>

    Fishing is still decent from the shore. There is a lot of fish up shallow in
the morning, but then they go deeper in the early afternoon. Fishing 2-2.5 inch
tube jigs, preferably white or translucent blue pepper tipped with Chub meat
or worm, is a great way to catch fish. Fishing on the bottom with half a worm and
half a marshmallow is also a good way to catch fish. Just remember to cast your
bottom gear shorter in the morning, but farther in the afternoon. Fishing a bobber
with a whole worm on about a 3-foot leader is also a great way to catch fish. Most
of the fish are around 14 to 15 inches. <strong>(Report from: 11/17/19)</strong>

    Fishing is good from the shore. The best method to use is casting 2 to 2.5"
white or translucent blue tube jigs tipped with chub meat using a jig and reel
method. In the mornings you don't need to let the tube jig sink very far, but in
the late mornings you will need to let the jig sink a bit farther. Another method
that works if the tube jigs aren't working is fishing half a worm and half a
marshmallow on the bottom with a 2 to 3 foot leader. You won't need to cast your
bottom gear out to far because the fish are in close due to cooler water temperatures.
