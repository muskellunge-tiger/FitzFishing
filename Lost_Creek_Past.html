  <h1>Lost Creek Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is good in the morning, but quickly dies off in the afternoon. Water
temperature is around 66 to 68 degrees. Most of the fish are 40 to 60 feet down.
Jigging blue pearl pepper tube jigs gets a lot of bites. In the morning casting
small spoons like junior Kamloopers and Pot-o-Golds will also get some bites.
Trolling pop gear and a worm can also catch a few fish. Just remember to use weight
or down riggers to get your gear down to the fish. <strong>(Report from: 8/22/19)</strong>

    Fishing is good from a boat in most of the lake. Trolling and jigging tube jigs
will catch you a good amount of fish. While it is clam find an area with a far
number of fish, and jig 1.5 to 2 inch white and translucent blue tube jigs tipped
with Chub meat. When the wind picks up troll silver willow leaf pop gear, sliver
triangle flashers, or sling rig dodgers with a worm at around 25-40 feet depending
on the time of day. <strong>(Report from: 7/25/19)</strong>
