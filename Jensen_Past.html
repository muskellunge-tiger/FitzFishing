  <h1>Jensen Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    The pond is completely ice free, and the fishing is pretty good. The best method
to use is fishing on the bottom with either half a worm and half a marshmallow or
a whole rainbow patterned Trout nugget. However, we recommend that you cut the
Trout nugget in half then put it on the hook, so that it will stay on the hook
better and give it a more compact look. This compact look is good because most of
the fish are smaller. Another method the works is bottom bouncing a 1.5" yellow
tube jig tipped with a piece of fire corn (pink piece of corn).

    The pond is pretty much unfrozen, and the fishing is slow. The best and only
method we found to work was fishing on the bottom with half a worm and half a
marshmallow on about a 6" leader. We tried fishing small tube jigs tipped with pink
maggots and a bobber with a worm, but were unable to catch any fish. Pretty much
all of the fish are very small. <strong>(Report from: 1/18/20)</strong>
