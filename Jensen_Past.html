  <h1>Jensen Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Fishing is really good right now; most methods work as long as they don't
require a fast retrieve because it is still a little too cold for spoons and spinners
to work. However, this does not mean that they won't work. It just means that they
won't work as well as other methods at this time. The best method to use is bottom
fishing either half a worm and half a marshmallow, chartreuse green powerbait, rainbow
Trout nuggets, or just a whole marshmallow. The leader length that works the best
for us is a 6" leader, but a longer leader will likely work too. Another method
that works is either slowly reeling in or bottom bouncing tube jigs or Marabou's.
The best color for tube jigs is orange or white, and the best Marabou color for
us was a white and green Marabou. We recommend that you tip your jigs with some
sort of bait. The bait we used was pink maggots, but worms or corn will also likely
work. <strong>(Report from: 2/2/20)</strong>

    The pond is completely ice free, and the fishing is pretty good. The best method
to use is fishing on the bottom with either half a worm and half a marshmallow or
a whole rainbow patterned Trout nugget. However, we recommend that you cut the
Trout nugget in half then put it on the hook, so that it will stay on the hook
better and give it a more compact look. This compact look is good because most of
the fish are smaller. Another method the works is bottom bouncing a 1.5" yellow
tube jig tipped with a piece of fire corn (pink piece of corn).

    The pond is pretty much unfrozen, and the fishing is slow. The best and only
method we found to work was fishing on the bottom with half a worm and half a
marshmallow on about a 6" leader. We tried fishing small tube jigs tipped with pink
maggots and a bobber with a worm, but were unable to catch any fish. Pretty much
all of the fish are very small. <strong>(Report from: 1/18/20)</strong>
