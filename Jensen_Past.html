  <h1>Jensen Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    When we went to Jensen the lake was mostly covered with very thin ice, so there
was not a lot of fishing spots. But because the ice was so thin, I'm sure it will
all melt in a day or two. The method that worked best was fishing rainobw powerbait
on the bottom with about a 2-foot leader. This caught us 2 fish, and got many more
bites. Another method that worked was casting small 1 inch tube jigs, and slowly
reeling them back. This caught us 1 fish, and got a few more bites. All in all,
fishing was very slow, but I think once the ice goes away and you are able to fish
more of the lake the fishing will pick up. <strong>(Report from: 2/8/19)</strong>
