  <h1>Holmes Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    While there is a fair amount of fish in the lake that are in close and hitting
the surface, the fishing is still a little slow. Spinners and spoons are quite
doing good yet, and tube jigs are also not performing well either. The only success
that we had was fishing with woolly bugger flies. We also some other people catch
a few fish off the bottom using worms. But mainly for right now it seems as if the
fishing is still slow. <strong>(Report from: 3/26/20)</strong>
