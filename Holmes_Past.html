  <h1>Holmes Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    Holmes is almost ice free. Most of the pond is open water with plenty of fishing
area. The water clarity is also fantastic. However, since it has been a while since
it has been stocked there seems to be little to no fish in the pond. I would recommend
waiting until it is stocked again before heading back out. <strong>(Report from: 3/20/19)</strong>
