  <h1>Holmes Past Reports</h1>
  <p>
    After a recent stocking of another 1,700 fish the fishing is getting really
good. Fishing with spoons is what we found to be the best option. Try using spoons
like Kamloopers or Pot-O-Golds. The best colors are red, white, and gold. The fishing
is best in the morning and early afternoon before it dies off in the middle of the
day. <strong>(Report from: 4/13/19)</strong>

    The fishing is getting fast after the recent stocking. Most fishing methods
will catch fish. We found that fishing with a small red and white Kamlooper worked
very well for fish on the surface. If you are fly fishing you will need to get your
fly out a long way, or get in pontoon boat to be successful. We also saw other
people catch stuff bottom fishing. All around the fishing is great. <strong>(Report from: 4/1/19)</strong>
