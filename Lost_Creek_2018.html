  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <h3>Spring</h3>
  <p>
    When fishing Lost Creek in the spring the best thing to use was fishing half
a worm and half a marshmallow with a water-bubble on the bottom. You would want to
have around a foot and a half long leader, but it seems to be that at Lost Creek
only, you can fish like this with a leader that can be up to three feet long and maybe
more. But usually you want to keep your leader in the foot and a half range cause
it is easier to cast. If you don't know what water-bubble is please read the paragraph
below. The other method that worked was fishing 2 to 3-inch white twisty tailed storm
minnows. You would want to do is cast the minnow out as far as you could, and then just
reel back really slow. If you ever feel any usual weight while you are doing this
set the hook cause the Cutthroats will sometimes just grab the minnow and swim with
it. Unlike the Rainbows which will most likely hit it pretty hard. Using this method
we caught our biggest Cutthroat out of Lost Creek. Another method that kind of worked
was using spoons, but we only caught one Splake while doing this.
  </p>
  <h3>Winter</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing Lost Creek in early to mid-November can bring some fantastic fishing.
Just remember that it can be very cold so wear layers. We found that the same
bottom fishing method that was used in the spring work this time of year as well.
The best method however, was fishing half a worm about a 2 to 3 feet under
a bobber. Using this we caught 3 different species of fish including: Cutthroat,
Rainbow, and Tiger Trout. The way we caught bigger Cutthroats was using a 2" white
tube jig with a 3/8oz jig head. You would want to be in deeper water when doing this
because you would want to jig to sink down deep to where the bigger Cutts would
hangout. The retrieve that worked was to do a somewhat hard-vertical jig and
then reel back down and repeat. Please check out the Strawberry report to see a
video on how to this method works.
  </p>
  <h3>What is a Water-bubble?</h3>
  <p>
    A water-bubble is a round oval like clear bubble that you fill with water to
allow baits to sink to the bottom. Now the reason I use this over snap weights is
because the water-bubble allows the line to slide through it, so the fish won't
feel any tension when it takes your bait. This will cause the fish to hold and eat
your bait for longer allowing you to get a better hook set. It will also allow you
to get a longer cast over snap weights.
