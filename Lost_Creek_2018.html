  <h2>Strategies</h2>
  <h3>Spring</h3>
  <p>
    When fishing Lost Creek in the spring the best thing to use was fishing half
a worm and half a marshmallow with a water-bubble on the bottom. You would want to
have around a foot and a half long leader, but it seems to be that at Lost Creek
only you can fish like this with a leader that can up to three feet long and maybe
more. But usually you want to keep your leader in the foot and a half range cause
it is easier to cast. If you don't know what water-bubble is please read the paragraph
below. The other method that worked was fishing 2 to 3 inch white twisty tailed storm
minnows. You would want to cast the minnow out as far as you could, and then just
reel back really slow. If you ever feel any usual weight while you are doing this
set the hook cause the Cutthroats will sometimes just grab the minnow and swim with
it. Unlike the Rainbows which will most likely hit it pretty hard. Using this method
we caught our biggest Cutthroat out of Lost Creek. Another method that kinda worked
was using spoons, but we only caught one Splake while doing this.

  <h3>Winter</h3>
  <p>
    Fishing Lost Creek in early to mid November can bring some fantastic fishing.
We found that the same bottom fishing method that was used in the spring work this
time of year as well. The best method however, was fishing half a worm with about
a 2 to 3 feet under a bobber. Using this we caught 3 different species of fish including:
Cutthroat, Rainbow, an Tiger Trout. The way we caught bigger Cutthroats was using
a 2" white tube jig with a 3/8oz head. You would want to be in deeper water when
doing this cause you would want to jig to sink down deep to where the bigger Cutts
would hangout. The retrieve you that worked was to do a hard vertical pop and then
reel back down and repeat. Please check out the Strawberry report to see a video
on how to this method works.
